In the early 1970s, he worked for Research Triangle Institute under a contract with the then new US Environmental Protection Agency on studies of the health effects of air pollution in Chattanooga. In 1978 he became a charter member of the American Institute of Certified Planners.

At Venture he oversaw the production of Vision 2000 - one of the first comprehensive Visioning projects in the United States - which ultimately involved dozens of meetings and approximately 3000 local citizens.  this effort is frequently cited as the turning point that led to Chattanooga's transformation.

Bragg had argued with his division commanders until they no longer trusted or respected him, and clamored for his replacement, but the tipping point was Bragg's passive-aggressive removal of cavalry commander Nathan Bedford Forrest from command, who furiously searched for Bragg, challenged him to a duel, and shot him in the foot.

It was initially commanded by Gordon Granger and its division commanders were Philip Sheridan, Charles Cruft, and Thomas J. Wood. It served with distinction in the famous unordered attack on Missionary Ridge at Chattanooga, and served in the Knoxville and Atlanta Campaigns. During John B. Hood's Franklin-Nashville Campaign, General William T. Sherman left the IV (and XXIII Corps), under the overall command of General George H.

Stanton came to Chattanooga in 1869 with funding from the Alabama government to expand railroads from the width of Alabama, reaching from Chattanooga, to Mississippi. He arrived in Chattanooga, which was still devastated from the war, with plans for reconstruction. Stanton, who soon set up his headquarters, promised economic prosperity in Chattanooga. The town welcomed Stanton in hopes that he could help boost the economy. The construction of railroads caused an economic boom and the town's economy improved substantially. Stanton soon built a new center of commerce which he named Stanton Town and it featured various shops, depots, employee housing and the Stanton House hotel. Stanton Town quickly became the most vibrant neighborhood in Chattanooga. The town was constructed on the south side of what is now Market Street. Stanton predicted the city would expand south, rather than focusing downtown on the riverfront.

His stout defense at the Battle of Chickamauga in 1863 saved the Union Army from being completely routed, earning him his most famous nickname, the Rock of Chickamauga. He followed soon after with a dramatic breakthrough on Missionary Ridge in the Battle of Chattanooga.

After the two-day Battle of Chickamauga in late September, Maj. Gen. Rosecrans, the commander of the Army of the Cumberland, was left trapped in Chattanooga, Tennessee and beset on all sides by Gen. Braxton Bragg's forces. Rosecrans telegraphed Washington: We have met a serious disaster, extent not yet ascertained. The situation in Chattanooga was desperate. The North needed the town in its hands. According to journalist Charles Anderson Dana, who had been Stanton's assistant secretary since March 1863, Rosecrans might only be able to fight for another 1520 more days and that without at least 20,000 to 25,000 men, Chattanooga would be lost. Lincoln and Stanton agreed to make Maj. Gen. Grant the commander of almost all forces in the west, while dismissing Rosecran from command of the Army of the Cumberland, and replacing him with Maj.

However, the waterfront areas were deemed too valuable as a commercial resource to use for the construction of a levee. After the bouts of flooding, a local newspaper article was released that stated the city's leaders planned on raised the grade of the streets of Chattanooga so that they would no longer flood. The people of Chattanooga began to raise the level of a few of the city's streets by 3 to 15 feet. Around 40 blocks of downtown Chattanooga was raised. Market and Broad Streets were completely filled, as well as portions of Cherry and Chestnut Streets. The method in which the city was raised is disputed, because there is no historical documentation. It was speculated that what was used in the raising was dirt from higher level areas of the town. Later, available records and soil boring showed that a variety of different materials such as foundry waste and sawmill scraps had been used in raising the city's streets.  In 1933 the  Tennessee Valley Authority in conjunction with Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal helped pass the Tennessee Valley Authority Act (1933) which prompted the construction of the Chickamauga Dam.

The rail bridge at Bridgeport was among those targeted by the East Tennessee bridge-burning conspiracy in November 1861. Although this attempt failed, the bridge would be burned twice during the course of the war.  Bridgeport was the site of a major skirmish on April 29, 1862, when Union General Ormsby Mitchel seized control of the city, and numerous other small actions over the following year as Confederate forces attempted to regain control of the area. The city was burned by Confederate troops under General Braxton Bragg in the Summer of 1863, but afterward reoccupied by Union forces. In the latter part of the war, Bridgeport was the site of a major shipyard building gunboats and transports for the Union Army. The USS Chattanooga was built here and became a vital part of the famous Cracker Line, which broke the Confederates' siege of Chattanooga in November 1863.

In 1941, Hunziker initiated graduate studies in tourism at the University of St. Gallen.  Hunziker founded a Tourism Research Institute at the University of St. Gallen in conjunction with that founded by Kurt Krapf at the University of Berne.  The Institute is now known as the Institut fr ffentliche Dienstleistungen und Tourismus (Institute for Public Service and Tourism).  In 1942, Hunziker collaborated with Krapf (director of the Bern Research Institute of Tourism) to publish the Outline of the General Teaching of Tourism (Grundriss der Allgemeinen Fremdenverkehrslehre), which became the standard work for basic research in tourism.  As part of this text, Hunziker and Krapf developed one of the first broadly accepted definitions of tourism (Fremdenverkehr), roughly translated as Tourism is the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of non-residents, in so far as they do not lead to permanent residence and are not connected with any earning activity.  A year later Hunziker published a book on the system of scientific tourism research (System und Hauptprobleme einer wissenschaftlichen Fremdenverkehrslehre) in which he tried to establish a completely new discipline as a branch of sociology; however, the attempt failed. But Hunziker and Krapf continued to examine tourism not only from an economic perspective, but also from a sociological one.

Under the overall objective of poverty reduction, the second ICP paid special attention to assisting the poorest provinces and most remote districts.With a budget of 42 million EUR, the third ICP (20112015) has a twofold approach. Poverty reduction remains the main objective, support through programmes in social sectors, namely health and local development. In addition the needs and new challenges faced by a middle income country are addressed through an increased focus on capacity building and human resource development in the banking and finance sector as well as in the vocational training sector including tourism and hospitality. With health, local development and vocational training as priority sectors and with a concentration of activities in the four provinces of Thua Thien Hue, Cao Bang, Bac Kan and Nghe An, the third ICP identifies the same priorities as the previous programme.If the current ICP is a continuity of previous interventions, it constitutes also a consolidation of Luxembourgs support and aims at diversifying relations between the two countries. With the achievement of the status of a middle income country, enhanced international and regional integration and with continued industrialisation, the needs of Vietnam in terms of international assistance have been changing. Luxembourg adapts its development cooperation accordingly and proposes further support in the field of green growth, capacity building in the finance and banking sector as well as in the sector of medical research. As the implementation of these activities can rely on specific expertise based in Luxembourg, they constitute adequate means to a transition to stronger and diversified relations beyond development cooperation between the two countries.The third ICP also takes into consideration recent developments in the field of aid effectiveness.A stronger emphasis on cooperation with the private sector is carried out through interventions in the banking and finance sector whereas local development projects aim at close cooperation with civil society and community based organisations. The ICP also includes a variety of aid modalities such as more programme oriented approaches in the health sector, a delegated cooperation to the health sector support programme implemented by the European Commission and collaboration with UN agencies. 20% of the financial envelope of ICP III is dedicated to multilateral projects targeting the same sectors as the bilateral projects, in order to strengthen synergies and to increase their impact.

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime targets the trafficking of women and children as a central concern in their approach to transnational crime. The United Nations Global Report on Trafficking in Persons states that women comprise the vast majority of human trafficking victims for sexual exploitation across the world. They also note that women make up a relatively large portion of human trafficking offenders  about 30% of convicted human traffickers are women. Samarasinghe argues that women who become involved in human trafficking were once victims of sex trafficking and sexual exploitation themselves. The only way for these women to gain economic security and freedom is therefore to participate in the trafficking system as well. These factors all contribute to the debate on human rights and their relations with sex tourism. In The Prostitution of Sexuality, Berry argues that the growing sex tourism industry reflects a global increase in sexual exploitation, and a lack of concern for the rights and dignity of sex workers. Berry states that sex tourism, as well as the growing international porn industry, indicate a normalization of prostitution and an increase in the exploitation of women. Additionally, Berry argues that sex tourism and prostitution directly contribute to gender inequality, and that general feminist political action should be expanded to include active opposition to prostitution.Sex tourism is also problematic in its violation of several central human capabilities. Nussbaums Capability approach argues that every human being has ten central human capabilities. The men, women, and children involved in prostitution and forced sex work are often considered to be lacking one or more of these capabilities. This is because their placement in these occupations are often driven by poverty and lack of economic opportunity, and by engaging in sex work they lose the right to dictate matters of their own sexuality and sexual health. This specifically is considered to violate the capability of bodily integrity.",CAR_940231167f28a35e362a6ee5e28f7ee5ff477b08,0," The Lookout Mountain Incline Railway is a  inclined plane railway located along the side of Lookout Mountain in the historic St. Elmo neighborhood of Chattanooga, Tennessee, in the United States.

Organized trips and studies were carried out in certain caves and karst regions of Bulgaria. The results obtained were published in the scientific publication of the Society - Bulletin of the Bulgarian Speleological Society - Volume One of which appeared in 1936. Active propaganda was also carried out for the protection of the caves. There was a useful and active cooperation between the Bulgarian Speleological Society and the Bulgarian Tourist Union.

However, there was a keenly felt need for a speleological organization in the country.Such an organization was necessary to unite the efforts of amateur speleologists and of the specialists and to promote the development of this branch of science in Bulgaria. Favourable conditions to that effect were created after 1957, with the restoration of the Bulgarian Tourist Union. At that time a number of scientists and amateur speleologists, as well as active supporters of the tourist movement, approached the Central Council of the Bulgarian Tourist Union with a proposal to set up a Committee for Cave Tourism. On July 14, 1958, the Central Council decided on setting up a Commission on Speleology and Cave Tourism. Forty-two clubs were set up all over the country.With the generous support of the Central Council of the Bulgarian Tourist Union, the new speleological organization rapidly grew in strength and became very active. Its objectives became clearly formulated and presented, and a number of enactments were passed. There were also a number of additional initiatives, such as plenary sessions, conferences, gatherings, and international expeditions. Penetration, charting, and survey work in the known caves and in the discovery of new cave sites became more active and on a higher scientific and technological level. The Commission on Speleology and Cave Tourism took on the task of the development and popularization of cave tourism in Bulgaria.After the Fourth Congress of the Bulgarian Tourist Union in 1972, the Commission on Speleology and Cave Tourism was transformed into the Bulgarian Federation on Speleology, which continues operating today. This new and higher form of organization furnished a fresh impetus to the development of Speleology in Bulgaria. Its operation became more active and efficient. New initiatives were undertaken with a view to improving the training and qualifications of the speleologists in the country. The speleological clubs obtained new equipment, and their activity increased. International ties grew stronger and broader. The successes attained were largely due to the correct understanding and to the moral and material support, which was and is still rendered by the Central Council of the Bulgarian Tourist Union.Today, the Bulgarian Federation on Speleology is the only national organization in Bulgaria whose role is essentially devoted to Speleology. The Federation represents the Bulgarian cavers and speleologists. In this capacity it organizes National Congresses, and within the International Union of Speleology it nominates the Bulgarian delegates at the International Congresses. The Federation co-ordinates both the activities of Bulgarian cavers abroad, establishing contacts with the corresponding Societies, and the activity of foreign cavers in Bulgaria. With 900 members in 2009, the Federation is organized on a national level (an executive committee, a board of directors, a head office in Sofia), and on regional level it has 35 speleo clubs. The Bulgarian Federation on Speleology, with its members - research workers and amateurs, is the sole organization in Bulgaria working for the advance of speleology and of cave tourism, and it is also the foremost unit carrying out the requisite research and protection of caves in the country. Bulgarian Federation of Speleology is a member of Balkan Speleological Union, European Federation of Speleology and International Speleological Union (U.I.S).",CAR_e38106b2280666011614ad991631bb953dffdd2b,0," Tourism in Ghana is regulated by the Ministry of Tourism of Ghana, the Government of Ghana ministry responsible for the development and promotion of tourism related activities in Ghana.",CAR_e46ddcb48268ad7ffe7970cf878ba3b58eb7e3a6,0," This nature reserve is vulnerable to industry and tourism.

It originally was a small city developed between the late 19th century and the mid-20th century. It is located two miles east of downtown Chattanooga, and bounded by Willow and Holtzclaw streets on the east and west, and McCallie and Main streets on the north and south. It was incorporated in 1905. Later, when it was incorporated into the City of Chattanooga in 1929, it grew to become a popular middle-class suburb with access to multiple train lines. As employment and much downtown property value in Chattanooga declined throughout the 1970s, Highland Park did as well, but it has had significant recent success due to its proximity to the downtown, its vibrant neighborhood association, and many newly renovated historic houses.",CAR_e4cdbec7df8f6140a20b99c1ba0d0b9cbb06db3d,0," If a switch becomes worn or the operating rods become damaged, it is possible for the flange to split the switch,  and go through the switch in the direction other than what was expected. This happens when the flange strikes a small gap between the fixed rail and the set switch point (whichever is touching the main line); this forces the switch open, and the train is diverted down the incorrect track. This can either happen to the locomotive, in which case the whole train can be directed onto the wrong track, with potentially dangerous results, or it can occur at any point through the train, when a random truck is directed down a different track from the rest of the train; if this happens on the front truck of a car, the usual result is derailment, as the trailing truck of the preceding car attempts to go one way, while the leading truck of the following car tries to go another. If it happens to the trailing truck of a car, the front truck will follow one track, while the trailing truck follows a parallel line; this causes the whole car to crab, or move sideways down the track (derailment often results eventually, due to the lateral forces applied when the train tries to brake or accelerate). This can have disastrous results if there is any obstacle between the lines, as the car will be propelled into it sideways, such as happened in the 1928 Times Square derailment. In some cases, the whole train behind the car will follow the errant car onto the other track; in others, only one or a few trucks are diverted, while the rest follow the correct track. In cases where it is a simple siding, rather than a continuous parallel track, the diverted truck(s) can travel the whole length of the siding until it turns back to the main track, where it performs a trailing point movement, forces the switch open, and ends up back on the same track again, with only damage to the switches. This is far less likely in cases of diversion to a parallel track, since switches on both lines will often be interconnected, so to set the switch on the main line to straight-through will set the other switch to straight-through as well (otherwise there is a risk of turning off the track only to find the joining switch is set the wrong way, and running the train through it). Because derailments are expensive and very dangerous to life and limb, maintenance of switch points and other trackwork is essential, especially with faster trains. Another derailment that occurred due to a split switch is the ProRail Hilversum derailment on 15 January 2014.",CAR_e5d3cc4325ffb3da6975f05869c34ee2c343c651,0,,

Compared to grades elsewhere, Monteagle's 46% grade does not come close to the steepest (I-40 between Nashville and Knoxville features 5% grades in each direction as well as a 5% grade north of Nashville on I-24, near Joelton), but the slope is protracted over a distance of several miles. While all motorists need to exercise caution, truckers are particularly vexed by Monteagle, and many have died going through this area. As runaway trucks had been a regular and deadly occurrence, in part of the failure or inability of truckers to slow down to the  truck speed limit once on the slope, the eastbound lanes were rebuilt in the late 1980s. This work reduced the grade, widened the road, added a required stopping area with traffic lights for trucks prior to descending the mountain, and added two runaway truck ramps where a truck whose brakes have failed due to overheating can exit into a long pit full of loose gravel to safely stop. Owing to geography, these two ramps are on the left side of the grade. This stretch of highway inspired Johnny Cash to write a song about Monteagle Mountain.  It is also mentioned in The Legend, the introductory song for Smokey and the Bandit, which touts the protagonist's driving skill in having reportedly navigated his truck down the Monteagle Grade during a heavy rainstorm, despite an airbrake failure.",CAR_f35a9644d1d2b6f14b0fe968629b9ab81deb0c82,0," Supercomputing technology applied to the problem of semi-trailer truck drag has helped to validate such aerodynamic improvements.

For this reason, environmentalists, special interest groups, and governments define ecotourism differently. Environmental organizations have generally insisted that ecotourism is nature-based, sustainably managed, conservation supporting, and environmentally educated. The tourist industry and governments, however, focus more on the product aspect, treating ecotourism as equivalent to any sort of tourism based in nature. As a further complication, many terms are used under the rubric of ecotourism. Nature tourism, low impact tourism, green tourism, bio-tourism, ecologically responsible tourism, and others have been used in literature and marketing, although they are not necessary synonymous with ecotourism.The problems associated with defining ecotourism have often led to confusion among tourists and academics. Definitional problems are also subject of considerable public controversy and concern because of green washing, a trend towards the commercialization of tourism schemes disguised as sustainable, nature based, and environmentally friendly ecotourism. According to McLaren, these schemes are environmentally destructive, economically exploitative, and culturally insensitive at its worst.

The song tells the story of traveling from New York City to Chattanooga. The inspiration for the song, however, was a small, wood-burning steam locomotive of the 2-6-0 type which belonged to the Cincinnati Southern Railway, which is now part of the Norfolk Southern Railway system. That train is now a museum artifact. From 1880, most trains bound for America's South passed through the southeastern Tennessee city of Chattanooga, often on to the super-hub of Atlanta.  The Chattanooga Choo Choo did not refer to any particular train, though some have incorrectly asserted that it referred to Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Railway's Dixie Flyer or the Southern Railway's Crescent Limited.  The most notable reason why the song isn't about any particular train is because of the line, nothing could be finerthan to have your ham and eggs in Carolina.

The song tells the story of traveling from New York City to Chattanooga. The inspiration for the song, however, was a small, wood-burning steam locomotive of the 2-6-0 type which belonged to the Cincinnati Southern Railway, which is now part of the Norfolk Southern Railway system. That train is now a museum artifact. From 1880, most trains bound for America's South passed through the southeastern Tennessee city of Chattanooga, often on to the super-hub of Atlanta.  The Chattanooga Choo Choo did not refer to any particular train, though some have incorrectly asserted that it referred to Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Railway's Dixie Flyer or the Southern Railway's Crescent Limited.  The most notable reason why the song isn't about any particular train is because of the line, nothing could be finerthan to have your ham and eggs in Carolina.

Though the Atlanta Crackers and Nashville Seraphs ended the 1895 season tied for first place, a series of events which transpired during and just after the season's end, resulted in Nashville claiming to be the rightful pennant winners and protesting the final standings. Their grounds for protest included three points. Firstly, a game played on August 10, dubbed the Glove Game, should have been thrown out because of the umpire's bad call surrounding a case of fan interference which potentially cost Nashville to lose the game. Secondly, the New Orleans Pelicans used an ineligible player who had been suspended from the Pennsylvania State League, and should forfeit all games in which he participated. Lastly, a game which Atlanta had played on the day after the season's end in order to make up for a rain-postponed game should be excluded from their record. Southern League and team representatives held a meeting in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to determine a winner. The members decided to throw out the Glove Game on the basis that the umpire's ruling was illegal since there was no rule providing for the punishment of a club for the interference of an outsider. Atlanta's August 3 game was also declared null since it was played after the season was over. Nashville withdrew its protest of New Orleans ineligible player. These rulings caused the Seraphs' winning percentage to rise to .676 (7134) and Atlanta's to fall to .667 (6834), making Nashville the league pennant winner.

His early efforts led to the adoption of Tennessee Scenic Routes legislation in 1971 and to some of the first environmental regulations and controls limiting signs and billboards.  In the early 1970s, he worked for Research Triangle Institute under a contract with the then new US Environmental Protection Agency on studies of the health effects of air pollution in Chattanooga. In 1978 he became a charter member of the American Institute of Certified Planners. He later served as Director of Economic Development for the City of Chattanooga - a position that ultimately led to his heading a joint economic development operation for the surrounding Hamilton County and the Chattanooga Area Chamber of Commerce. In 1982, he was selected to head Chattanooga Venture - a special purpose nonprofit organization aimed at transforming Chattanooga.  At Venture he oversaw the production of Vision 2000 - one of the first comprehensive Visioning projects in the United States - which ultimately involved dozens of meetings and approximately 3000 local citizens.  this effort is frequently cited as the turning point that led to Chattanooga's transformation.

In 1987, he was elected Commissioner of Public Works under the old commission form of government that was in place in Chattanooga at that time.  In that office, he led an effort to reform the local government by abandoning the commission form and adopting a more modern strong mayor  council form with legislative representatives selected from single member districts.

Though the Atlanta Crackers and Nashville Seraphs ended the 1895 season tied for first place, a series of events which transpired during and just after the season's end, resulted in Nashville claiming to be the rightful pennant winners and protesting the final standings. Their grounds for protest included three points. Firstly, a game played on August 10, dubbed the Glove Game, should have been thrown out because of the umpire's bad call surrounding a case of fan interference which potentially cost Nashville to lose the game. Secondly, the New Orleans Pelicans used an ineligible player who had been suspended from the Pennsylvania State League, and should forfeit all games in which he participated. Lastly, a game which Atlanta had played on the day after the season's end in order to make up for a rain-postponed game should be excluded from their record. Southern League and team representatives held a meeting in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to determine a winner. The members decided to throw out the Glove Game on the basis that the umpire's ruling was illegal since there was no rule providing for the punishment of a club for the interference of an outsider. Atlanta's August 3 game was also declared null since it was played after the season was over. Nashville withdrew its protest of New Orleans ineligible player. These rulings caused the Seraphs' winning percentage to rise to .676 (7134) and Atlanta's to fall to .667 (6834), making Nashville the league pennant winner.

The event notification protocol defined in the UPnP Device Architecture is known as General Event Notification Architecture (GENA). A UPnP description for a service includes a list of actions the service responds to and a list of variables that model the state of the service at run time. The service publishes updates when these variables change, and a control point may subscribe to receive this information. The service publishes updates by sending event messages. Event messages contain the names of one or more state variables and the current value of those variables. These messages are also expressed in XML. A special initial event message is sent when a control point first subscribes; this event message contains the names and values for all evented variables and allows the subscriber to initialize its model of the state of the service. To support scenarios with multiple control points, eventing is designed to keep all control points equally informed about the effects of any action. Therefore, all subscribers are sent all event messages, subscribers receive event messages for all evented variables that have changed, and event messages are sent no matter why the state variable changed (either in response to a requested action or because the state the service is modeling changed).",CAR_e0cd85926936a03ed20df42d61abeda7effccc5d,0," Most of the numerous high quality independent films show on the five screens at the art-deco Varsity Theatre located in the heart of  historic downtown Ashland, a city that was referred to in the Washington Post as a dream ... and wish you'd never have to leave.

There was, however, a certain old woman called Goga who thus prepared food for ten of the youths, but for herself she cooked food with fire, which she obtained from her own body. Before the boys came home each day, she cleared away all traces of the fire and every scrap of cooked food that they should not know her secret; but one day a piece of boiled taro accidentally got among the lads' food, and when the youngest ate it, he found it much better than what was usually given him. The youths resolved to discover the secret, so the next day, when they went to hunt, the youngest hid at home and saw the old woman take the fire from her body and cook with it. After his companions had returned, he told them what he had seen, and they determined to steal some of the fire. Accordingly, on the following day they cut down a huge tree, over which all tried to jump, but only the youngest succeeded, so they selected him to steal the fire. He waited until the others had gone, and then creeping back to the house, he seized the firebrand when the old woman was not looking, and ran off with it. The old woman chased him, but he jumped over the tree, which she was unable to do. As he ran on, however, the brand burned his hand, and he dropped it in the dry grass, which caught the blaze and set fire to a pandanus-tree which was near. Now, in a hole in this tree, lived a snake, whose tail caught fire and burned like a torch. The old woman, finding that she could not overtake the thief, caused a great rain to fall, hoping thus to quench the fire, but the snake stayed in his hole, and his tail was not extinguished. When the rain had stopped, the boys went out to look for fire, but found none, because the rain had put it all out; but at last they saw the hole in the tree, pulled out the snake, and broke off its tail, which was still alight. Then making a great pile of wood, they set fire to it, and people from all the villages came and got flame, which they took home with them. Different folk used different kinds of wood for their firebrands and the trees from which they took their brands became their pitani (totems). A snake in this tale plays the part of the saviour of fire; but in other forms of the myth the serpent is the real source or bringer of flame. A version from the Admiralty Islands runs as follows: The daughter of Ulimgau went into the forest. The serpent saw her, and said, Come! and the woman replied, Who would have you for a husband? You are a serpent. I will not marry you. But he replied, My body is indeed that of a serpent, but my speech is that of a man. Come! And the woman went and married him, and after a time she bore a boy and a girl, and her serpent husband put her away, and said, Go, I will take care of them and give them food. And the serpent fed the children and they grew. And one day they were hungry, and the serpent said to them, Do you go and catch fish. And they caught fish and brought them to their father. And he said, Cook the fish. And they replied, The sun has not yet risen. By and by the sun rose and warmed the fish with its rays, and they ate the food still raw and bloody. Then the serpent said to them, You two are spirits, for you eat your food raw. Perhaps you will eat me. You, girl, stay; and you, boy, crawl into my belly. And the boy was afraid and said, What shall I do? But his father said to him, Go, and he crept into the serpent's belly. And the serpent said to him, Take the fire and bring it out to your sister. Come out and gather coco-nuts and yams and taro and bananas. So the boy crept out again, bringing the fire from the belly of the serpent.

Upon exiting the cave, the visitors could catch the train from Shellmound (located directly in front of the cave entrance) back to Chattanooga. By 1927 the cave was being shown by Lawrence S. Ashley, who supposedly disappeared in the cave during exploration. His disappearance was covered by both the local Chattanooga newspapers and the New York Times. After being lost from August 15, 1927 through August 22, 1927, Ashley reappears, claiming that he dug his way out through a new entrance located 8 miles away.

There was, however, a certain old woman called Goga who thus prepared food for ten of the youths, but for herself she cooked food with fire, which she obtained from her own body. Before the boys came home each day, she cleared away all traces of the fire and every scrap of cooked food that they should not know her secret; but one day a piece of boiled taro accidentally got among the lads' food, and when the youngest ate it, he found it much better than what was usually given him. The youths resolved to discover the secret, so the next day, when they went to hunt, the youngest hid at home and saw the old woman take the fire from her body and cook with it. After his companions had returned, he told them what he had seen, and they determined to steal some of the fire. Accordingly, on the following day they cut down a huge tree, over which all tried to jump, but only the youngest succeeded, so they selected him to steal the fire. He waited until the others had gone, and then creeping back to the house, he seized the firebrand when the old woman was not looking, and ran off with it. The old woman chased him, but he jumped over the tree, which she was unable to do. As he ran on, however, the brand burned his hand, and he dropped it in the dry grass, which caught the blaze and set fire to a pandanus-tree which was near. Now, in a hole in this tree, lived a snake, whose tail caught fire and burned like a torch. The old woman, finding that she could not overtake the thief, caused a great rain to fall, hoping thus to quench the fire, but the snake stayed in his hole, and his tail was not extinguished. When the rain had stopped, the boys went out to look for fire, but found none, because the rain had put it all out; but at last they saw the hole in the tree, pulled out the snake, and broke off its tail, which was still alight. Then making a great pile of wood, they set fire to it, and people from all the villages came and got flame, which they took home with them. Different folk used different kinds of wood for their firebrands and the trees from which they took their brands became their pitani (totems). A snake in this tale plays the part of the saviour of fire; but in other forms of the myth the serpent is the real source or bringer of flame. A version from the Admiralty Islands runs as follows: The daughter of Ulimgau went into the forest. The serpent saw her, and said, Come! and the woman replied, Who would have you for a husband? You are a serpent. I will not marry you. But he replied, My body is indeed that of a serpent, but my speech is that of a man. Come! And the woman went and married him, and after a time she bore a boy and a girl, and her serpent husband put her away, and said, Go, I will take care of them and give them food. And the serpent fed the children and they grew. And one day they were hungry, and the serpent said to them, Do you go and catch fish. And they caught fish and brought them to their father. And he said, Cook the fish. And they replied, The sun has not yet risen. By and by the sun rose and warmed the fish with its rays, and they ate the food still raw and bloody. Then the serpent said to them, You two are spirits, for you eat your food raw. Perhaps you will eat me. You, girl, stay; and you, boy, crawl into my belly. And the boy was afraid and said, What shall I do? But his father said to him, Go, and he crept into the serpent's belly. And the serpent said to him, Take the fire and bring it out to your sister. Come out and gather coco-nuts and yams and taro and bananas. So the boy crept out again, bringing the fire from the belly of the serpent. And then having brought the food, the boy and girl lit a fire with the brand which the boy had secured and cooked the food. And when they had eaten, the serpent said to them, Is my kind of food or your kind of food the better? And they answered, Your food is good, ours is bad.",CAR_19af1f3aaf181ac3e59fd4983e753d54d1dec4a2,0," Restaurants in East Ridge. 1  Hickory Pit Bar-B-Que Chattanooga 1.1 mi away. 2  Portofino Pizza Italian Restaurant. 3  Bluegrass Grill Chattanooga 4.4 mi away.
