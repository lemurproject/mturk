Also, in many parts of the world such as India, people consider using water a much cleaner and more sanitary practice than using paper. Cleansing is then performed with other methods or materials, such as water, for example using a bidet, a lota, rags, sand, leaves (including seaweed), corn cobs, animal furs, sticks or hands; afterwards, hands are washed with soap.","CAR_14b05bb8fd2881ce3916ca3049446366918fa21d","0"," A low-flush toilet (or low-flow toilet or high-efficiency toilet), is a flush toilet that uses significantly less water than a full-flush toilet. Low-flush toilets use  or less per flush as opposed to  or more. They came into use in the United States in the 1990s, in response to water conservation concerns. Low-flush toilets include single-flush models and dual-flush toilets, which typically use 1.6 USgpf for the full flush and 1.28 US for a reduced flush.","CAR_18b6e0a00782eb21fcacb8e19ba56a994d2e43ec","0"," Universal released a theatrical trailer for Mr Baseball in the summer of 1992. The trailer, which runs two minutes and fourteen seconds, features dialogue and scenes that are absent from the final version of the film. For example, at the scene of Jack's first press conference, Yoji asks, have you ever slept with Madonna? During his first meeting with Uchiyama, Jack responds to the demand to shave his moustache by saying, he probably can't even grow one. In the locker room scene where Jack is confused about how to use the Japanese-style toilet, he quips to Max, I need somebody to tell me how to go to the can (later changed in the final version of the film to I need somebody tell me how to take a crap). The music in the trailer is mostly sampled from Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack, but also includes samples from Turning Japanese by the The Vapors. The song also appears in the MCA Universal Home Video promotional tape distributed to video rental shops in 1993. Turning Japanese did not appear in the final version of the soundtrack.","CAR_1b3c4a26c711f5d9449c836ed2667a32bd05d9df","0"," The driver of the truck finds and tracks Gene back to the restaurant, where Bob and Linda are on their way to celebrate the dismissal of his ticket, mostly due to how rich he looks in the said suit. The truck driver, who introduces himself as Max Flush, announces that his toilet costs $14,000 and that he's very motivated to locate it. When Gene refuses to tell him the location of the toilet, he stakes outside the restaurant. The kids enlist the help of the Pesto children and Zeke to transfer the toilet in a safer place.

Similar to powder room, toilet then came to be used as a euphemism for rooms dedicated to urination and defecation, particularly in the context of signs for public toilets, as on trains. Finally, it came to be used for the plumbing fixtures in such rooms (apparently first in the United States) as these replaced chamber pots, outhouses, and latrines. These two uses, the fixture and the room, completely supplanted the other senses of the word during the 20th century except in the form toiletries.","CAR_1ffa74ba232814f20bc6cbb5f1ae52e4ecf93643","0","null"

For example, the inside of the house is considered a clean area, whereas the outside of the house is considered unclean. To keep the two areas separated, shoes are taken off before entering the house so that the unclean shoes do not touch the clean area inside of the house. Historically, toilets were located outside of the house, and shoes were worn for a trip to the toilet. Nowadays, the toilet is almost always inside the home and hygienic conditions have improved significantly, but the toilet is still considered an unclean area. To minimize contact between the unclean toilet floor and the clean floor in the rest of the house, many private homes and also some public toilets have  in front of the toilet door that should be used when in the toilet and removed right after leaving the toilet. This also indicates if the toilet is in use. They can be as simple as a pair of rubber slippers, decorated slippers with prints of anime characters for small children, or even animal fur slippers. A frequent faux pas of foreigners is to forget to take off the toilet slippers after a visit to the restroom, and then use these in the non-toilet areas, hence mixing the clean and unclean areas.","CAR_41190ffa0b4008c19f5a70a3ae91c8f1fdc43ed9","0"," They go on to tell Smecker the events that happened: Right after the MacManus brothers offered a drink and a stool to the Russian mobsters.

As Rocco lie in pain, Connor and Murphy speak to the mobsters in Russian, as they look on in disbelief, take a shot, then proceed to return the favor, sucker punching the Russian. A brawl ensues, where the brothers and friends, over match and overpower the out numbered mobsters. One mobster is taken out with a couple of liquor bottles to the head. At the end, the main Russian is tied to the top of the counter, while Connor proceeds to pour liquor on the Russians posterior and lights it on fire. The scene ends with the Russian screaming in pain, butt aflame. The next morning, as the MacManus brothers are waking up in their lower class apartment. Two of the Russians, still bandaged from the fight the night before. Come barging in, in pursuit of vengeance. Catching the brothers off guard, guns in their face, they cuff Connor to the toilet, and take Murphy to the alley.

Her brother Zeeshan (Agha Ali) loves her but hates her attitude. The mother and the daughters hate their father's brother Baseer and his family. His family consists of him, his wife Nayyara(Ismat Zaidi) and three daughters Fala(Madiha Rizvi), Haya(Ayeza Khan) and Fariya(Aiman Khan). They all are well-mannered but middle class as compared to Shaista. Shaista always insults Nayyara and treats her daughters as servants. Muskaan goes to her aunt Nayyara's house where she asks Fala to do her Pedicure and Manicure as Fala had done many parlour courses but says not to even do anything to her face as she will do from some another place and tells to wear good clothes during engagement. The family has a cloth sewing business while Haya goes to office. Zeeshan always offers to drop her but she rejects. Shaista comes to Nayyara's house and insults her by giving a cloth and tells her to sew and wear this during Muskan's engagement. She always treats Nayyara's family as her shoe. Muskaan's father Nasir comes from Dubai with lots of things for her daughters and wife but Zeeshan is fine with it. Iraj likes a bottle of perfume because of which Muskaan is jealous and they start fighting like cats resulting in breaking of perfume bottle. But their mother Shaista is busy looking in things. Love is the only emotion between Nayyara's daughters while Iraj and Muskaan are always fighting like cats. Nasir goes to Nayyara's house and it is later revealed that he used to love Nayyara in his young time. It was Shaista who had come between them.Nayyara used to like Nasir but Nayyara respects him now. He gives some money to her daughters out of love and Iraj sees this.

She does not listen to Danish and once when her mother-in-law wants to go for a Get Together party, she makes her fun by saying that you are so old still you want to party. She insults her mother-in-law. Fala and Ayaan are happy with each other. But Sulaiman's mother and Ayaan's ex-wife Mariya comes to meet Sulaiman. Naima puts forth a condition that if she wants to meet her son, she has to take him forever. Ayaan and Fala are against it but they have to accept it. Shehryar betrays Iraj and leaves her. Iraj comes back and says the truth about jewellery. Nasir gets a heart attack and dies. His last wish is that Haya should be the daughter-in-law of the house.

A prime example of this is vaguada, which is a corruption of the English bad weather, though in Dominican Spanish the term has come to mean storm or torrential downpour, rather than a spot of unpleasant climate. Hence, a common Dominican expression: Viene una vaguada, here comes a vaguada, or here comes a storm. Another excellent example of this is boche, a corruption of the English bull shit, though in Dominican Spanish the term has come to mean a reprimanding, fulmination, or harangue in general terms. Hence, a common Dominican expression: Me echaron un boche, they threw me a boche, or they reprimanded me. The pronoun they in Dominican Spanish often refers to the third person singular, so that me dijeron, they told me, is sometimes used instead of a man told me, or a woman told me, or the young boy by the lemon tree told me. Furthermore, is the Dominican Spanish word for SUV, yipeta, jeepeta, or rarely gipeta. This term is a corruption of the American Jeep, which was the primary mode of transport for the GI's throughout the country during the occupation in the 1960s. Dominican license plates for SUVs are marked with a G for gipeta, a variant of, and pronounced like, yipeta, before their serial number.

One third of them had indoor toilets, a rarity in a society typically featuring public banks of outdoor seats in urban environments, side by side, an arrangement for which the flowing robes of the ancients were suitably functional. Indoor plumbing requires more extensive water supply and sewage systems. Priene's location was appropriate in that regard; they captured springs and streams on Mycale, brought them in by aqueduct to cisterns and piped or channeled from there to houses and fountains. Most Greek cities, such as Athens, required visits to the public fountains (the work of domestic servants), but the upper third of Prieneian society had access to indoor water.","CAR_478c2d2d3833ce14d47e1d7aa71064cba36f15da","0"," The Sublime Society of Beef Steaks was established in 1735 by John Rich at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, of which he was then manager. One version of its origin has it that the Earl of Peterborough, supping one night with Rich in his private room, was so delighted with the steak Rich grilled him that he suggested a repetition of the meal the next week. Another version is that George Lambert, the scene-painter at the theatre, was often too busy to leave the theatre and contented himself with a beefsteak broiled upon the fire in the painting-room. His visitors so enjoyed sharing this dish that they set up the Sublime Society.  William and Robert Chambers, writing in 1869, favour the second version, noting that Peterborough was not one of the original members. A third version, favoured by  the historian of the society, Walter Arnold, is that the society was formed out of the regular dinners shared at the theatre by Rich and Lambert, consisting of hot steak dressed by Rich, accompanied by a bottle of old port from the tavern hard by. Whatever the details of its genesis, Rich and Lambert are listed as the first two of the society's twenty-four founding members. Women were not admitted.  From the outset, the society strove to avoid the term club, but the shorter Beefsteak Club was soon used by many as an informal alternative.","CAR_4ccd21cebaae180a616352e276c34adff1690805","0","null"

Horticultural societies are generally situated in semi-sedentary villages of a few hundred that clear a field and burn the cleared vegetation in order to use the ashes to nourish the soil (hence the phrase slash and burn). Next, the group plants a crop or crops in this clearing and uses it for cultivation for several years. At the end of this period, the entire village relocates and starts the process anew, leaving the old clearing fallow for a period of decades in order to allow regeneration through the regrowth of wild vegetation. These food items can be supplemented through the raising of livestock, hunting wild game, and in many cases with the gathering of wild plants (Miller 2005; Park 2006). Though periodic movement precludes absolute permanent ownership of land, some horticultural societies fiercely defend current territories and practice violence against neighboring groups. For instance, Napoleon Chagnon (1997) depicts the Yanamamo of Venezuela and Brazil as the Fierce People, though others have been highly critical of Chagnons account of this society. Horticulture can also produce a broad diet, and in some cases more food per unit of land area than foraging. Though populations of horticulturalists tend to have greater density than those of foragers, they are generally less dense than those which practice other modes of production. If practiced on a small scale, over a large area, with long fallow periods, horticulture has less negative environmental impact than agriculture or industrialism, but more than foraging (Miller 2005). Generally, horticulture coincides with a subsistence type of economy in terms of production, distribution.Pastoralism, defined as reliance on products from livestock coupled with a seasonal nomadic herding tradition, is similar to horticulture in that it is extensive in its use of land area. Social groups in pastoral societies tend to have similar numbers and population density to horticultural societies. Pastoral societies often trade animal products with agricultural societies for plant based foods to augment their diet. Frequent movement often means that pastoralism has a similar environmental impact to horticulture, though instances of overgrazing, and consequent land degradation (see later subsection under Globalization and Nutrition), have been sited in some cases. Pastoralism generally entails a greater reliance on meat or other animal products, such as milk or blood, than other modes of production. This mode of production has a similar use rights profile to shifting cultivation. Traditionally, pastoralism has coincided with a subsistence based economy, but in the last several decades, some pastoralist societies, such as Mongolia, have herded animals and practiced nomadic living patterns but have produced livestock primarily for market exchange.Agriculture, sometimes referred to as intensive agriculture, involves clearing and using the same plot of land for an extended period, sometimes several generations; it also involves the use of plows and draft animals in the preparation of land for planting and the cultivation of crops. Agriculture often supports much higher population densities than other modes of production (except industrialism) and agricultural societies can range in population from a few thousand into the millions. Though agriculture produces more food per unit of land area than the previously mentioned modes, the tendency of agricultural societies to focus on relatively few crops has often meant that these societies have much less diverse diets than foraging and horticultural societies. There is some archaeological and fossil evidence that populations in transition from foraging to agriculture have tended to suffer reduced stature, reduced musculature, and to exhibit other markers of malnutrition. Research has suggested that agriculture paradoxically allows a higher, but less healthy population for a given area. The advent of agriculture has marked that advent of social stratification in many parts of the world, with marked differentials in access to resources between segments of the same society. This mode of production also is more likely to entail permanent individual or family ownership of particular tracts of land than previously mentioned modes of production. Agriculture has co-occurred with both subsistence and market economies, often with a single society exhibiting some degree of both types of economies and has a more negative impact on the environment than the aforementioned modes of production.Industrialism combines agriculture with mechanized industrial production of goods through the use of fossil fuels. Additionally, industrial societies use mechanized equipment in order to prepare land for planting, harvest crops, and distribute food to locations distant from where the original crops were planted. Industrialism shows similar trends to agriculture in terms of population density, and environmental impact, except to a much greater degree. Dietary diversity can be highly variable under an industrial mode of production and can depend on access to foods produced for local subsistence on the one hand, or to income level and purchasing power visa vie foods available in food markets (Leatherman and Goodman 2005). Dietary diversity and nutritional health often correlate with the degree of social stratification within an industrial society and sometimes between societies. With the exception of Soviet model states, industrial societies are heavily based on the concept of private property rights and the accumulation of profit through free enterprise.The general trend for many societies over the past several millennia has been toward agriculture, and in the past two centuries, toward industrialism. Though these two modes of production are by no means superior to other modes in every respect, the fact that societies that practice them tend to have larger populations, higher population densities, and a more complex social structure has correlated with the geographic expansion of agricultural and industrial societies at the expense of societies emphasizing other modes of production. Concurrent with this trend toward intensified agricultural and industrial production has been the rise of the social and economic paradigm of capitalism, which entails the production and sale of goods and services in the market place in order to produce a profit. These trends have had profound implications for nutritional status for human beings on a global scale. In order to discern how broader economic and environmental trends affect a communitys food systems, food security, and nutritional status, it is important to summarize one of the most significant economic and ecological phenomena today, globalization. The next section will treat the linkages between economic and ideological trends over the last several centuries and environmental and political economic factors affecting access to food and nutritional status.","CAR_fb2f270d1945ebf723b13f11f5f8eff26e58d4c6","0","null"

Before making his start in films, Rivero studied to become a Shakespearean actor with the famous stage actor Robert B. Mantell.  His first appearance was in a small role in the 1923 film, The Bright Shawl, which was produced by Inspiration Pictures, and east coast film company, and was shot in Cuba. His first featured role was in the 1921 western, Fast and Fearless, which starred Jay Wilsey (known by his stage name as Buffalo Bill, Jr.) and Jean Arthur. He entered sound films in 1930 in the Spanish language films As es la vida and El presidio (the Spanish version of The Big House. During the early 1930s, while Hollywood was still making versions of films in different languages, Rivero continued to be cast in Spanish language films, his final one being 1934's Nada ms que una mujer, the Spanish version of Pursued. His first sound film in English was God's Country and the Man (1931), written and directed by J.P. McCarthy. During the 1930s and 1940s many of his roles were in westerns.  Some of his more notable films during those decades include: the 1932 drama, Winner Take All, starring James Cagney; a small role in the 1935 biopic Diamond Jim, starring Edward Arnold and Jean Arthur; the role of Santa Anna in the 1937 historical drama Heroes of the Alamo; he had a small role in Betty Grable's first starring vehicle, Down Argentine Way (1940); he appeared in the bullfighting film, Blood and Sand (1941), starring Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell; he had another small role in the 1942 remake of Rio Rita, starring Abbott and Costello; he played one of the Spanish officials in the Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn vehicle, Woman of the Year (1942); he played one of the monks in The Song of Bernadette, starring Jennifer Jones; he played a waiter in final American film of Laurel and Hardy, 1945's The Bullfighters; he played a government clerk in Anna and the King of Siam, starring Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison; as a manservant in the Bob Hope and Bing Crosby road picture, Road to Rio (1947); and the barber in John Huston's classic western, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), starring Humphrey Bogart.","CAR_0a2cbe5942b56c42fb56f5033eb2775ad3af3d78","0"," The traditional Japanese-style (, washiki) toilet is a squat toiletalso known as the 'Asian Toilet,' as squat toilets of somewhat similar design are common all over Asia. A squat toilet differs from a Western toilet in both construction and method of employment. A squat toilet essentially looks like a miniature urinal set horizontally into the floor. Most squat toilets in Japan are made of porcelain, although in some cases (as on trains) stainless steel is used instead. The user squats over the toilet, facing the hemispherical hood, i.e., the wall in the back of the toilet in the picture seen on the right. A shallow trough collects the waste, instead of a large water-filled bowl as in a Western toilet. All other fixtures, such as the water tank, piping, and flushing mechanism, may be identical to those of a Western toilet. Flushing causes water to push the waste matter from the trough into a collecting reservoir which is then emptied, with the waste carried off into the sewer system. The flush is often operated in the same manner as a Western toilet, though some have pull handles or pedals instead. Many Japanese toilets have two kinds of flush: small () and large (). The difference is in the amount of water used. The former is for urine (in Japanese, literally small excretion) and the latter for feces (large excretion). The lever is often pushed to the small setting to provide a continuous covering noise for privacy, as discussed below.","CAR_f1e6576ddb48ced08cd7c0dfef5d436c1f8d02a6","0"," In the 1960s and 1970s, feminists such as Clare Short, Gaye Tuchman, and Angela McRobbie denounced unfair representations of gender in media and especially in magazines. Germaine Greer, Australian-born author of The Female Eunuch (1970), offered a systematic deconstruction of ideas such as womanhood and femininity, arguing that women are forced to assume submissive roles in society to fulfill male fantasies of what being a woman entails.  Greer wrote that women were perceived as mere consumers benefiting from the purchasing power of their husband. Women become targets for marketing, she said, and their image is used in advertising to sell products.  American socialist writer and feminist, Sharon Smith wrote on the first issue of Women and Film that women's roles in film almost always revolve around her physical attraction and the mating games she plays with the male characters in contrast to men's roles, which according to the author are more varied. In 1973 Marjorie Rosen, an important contributor to feminist film theory, argued that the Cinema Woman is a Popcorn Venus, a delectable but insubstantial hybrid of cultural distortions. In 1978 Gaye Tuchman wrote of the concept of symbolic annihilation, blaming the media for imposing a negative vision of active women and making an apologia for housewives. She feared that stereotypes would discourage young women from professional ambitions, which are essential for the American economy.","CAR_f4744857cfc176854d1124663be2daf51aed6b7e","0"," Mainly outside the commercial sector, film makers from the new commonwealth countries had begun to emerge during the 1970s. Horace Ov's Pressure (1975) had been funded by the British Film Institute as was A Private Enterprise (1974), these being the first Black British and Asian British films respectively. The 1980s however saw a wave of new talent, with films such as Franco Rosso's Babylon (1980), Menelik Shabazz's Burning an Illusion (1981) and Po-Chih Leong's Ping Pong (1986; one of the first films about Britain's Chinese community). Many of these films were assisted by the newly formed Channel 4, which had an official remit to provide for minority audiences. Commercial success was first achieved with My Beautiful Laundrette (1985). Dealing with racial and gay issues, it was developed from Hanif Kureishi's first film script. My Beautiful Laundrette features Daniel Day-Lewis in a leading role.

The 3 factors they test are: 1. Are there at least 2 women in the film who have names? 2. Do those women talk to each other? 3. Do they talk to each other about something other than a man? (Sharma & Sender, 2014). Many roles that are given to women make them either dependent on the male counterpart or make their role more limited. Another characteristic of their role placement is that women are twice as likely to have a life-related role rather than a work-related role. Hollywood rarely chooses to have women be the all-powerful boss or to even have a successful career. There have been some examples that break this Norm such as The Proposal or I Don't Know How She Does It. Even in these 2 films the male counterpart is a strong role and in both the female lead is reliant on both actors for the storyline. Women do not stand on their own in movies and rarely are the center of attention without a male being there to steal the limelight. Some roles that have been portrayed in recent films have worked against this normative such as Katniss in Hunger Games and Furiosa in Mad Max: Fury Road. These roles break the norm which is definitely a step in the right direction. Typically women are portrayed as dependent on other characters, over-emotional, and confined to low status jobs when compared to enterprising and ambitious male characters (Bussey & Bandura, 1999). Women in cinema are grossly misrepresented and definitely under represented and it is up to us as a society to change that.","CAR_11723b2253541d008ae167f9b13ecbb1f146f1f1","0"," In the plumbing world, most toilets are one of two sizes: standard and elongated. A standard size toilet, also referred to as round, has historically been the most common in American homes. However, the elongated size toilet, sometimes called oblong, is often installed in homes being built today thanks to its more luxurious larger size. To determine which size toilet you have, and thus which size toilet seat will fit your toilet, grab a measuring tape. Measure the length of the toilet bowl from the hinge post holes to the front rim. If the length is about 16-17 inches, a standard round toilet seat will fit your toilet. If the length is 18-19 inches, an elongatedoblong toilet seat will fit. Both toilet seat sizes have a width of about 14.5 inches, and in the United States, the distance between the hinge post holes is about 5.5 inches.
