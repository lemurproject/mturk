All of these, in one way or another, related to improvements to the toilet or associated devices.  The toilet was not the invention of a single person.  It evolved into its present form through contributions from various sources.  The Romans had toilets that conveyed away waste with running water.  In the 1590s, Englishman, Sir John Harington (15611612) contrived a crude flush toilet.  However, Haas' efforts, perhaps more so than those of any other one person, helped transform the toilet from a notoriously unreliable device into the modern commode.",CAR_02d7986bbd451f51afc8a1ff4dbb8dc423567b93,0," Serious waterborne diseases such as cholera and diarrhea occur when open defecation or poor sanitation permits human waste to pollute water supplies. Historically, sanitation has been a concern from the earliest stages of human settlements. The Indus Valley Civilization is particularly notable for its extensive sanitation works, including private flush toilets. For the most part, early cities emptied their waste into rivers or seas manually or via open ditches. Sanitation in ancient Rome was notably advanced, as were some of the reredorters of medieval monasteries, but emptying of chamber pots into city streets continued into the modern era. A precursor to the modern flush toilet system was designed by John Harington in 1596 but did not become common until the late 19th century. Even London, at that time the world's largest city, did not require indoor toilets in its building codes until after the First World War.",CAR_07142d6ac6d1dd0ecec4cd00c956b9bc5cf66c78,0," Toilet was originally a French loanword (first attested in 1540) that referred to the toilette (little cloth) draped over one's shoulders during hairdressing. During the late 17th century, the term came to be used by metonymy in both languages for the whole complex of grooming and body care that centered at a dressing table (also covered by a cloth) and for the equipment composing a toilet service, including a mirror, hairbrushes, and containers for powder and makeup. The time spent at such a table also came to be known as one's toilet; it came to be a period during which close friends or tradesmen were received as toilet-calls.",CAR_073c7db14518d5bfd16f10bc7cd6d995ecc69950,0," Other features may include a heated seat, which may be adjustable from 30 C to 40 C; an automatic lid equipped with a proximity sensor, which opens and closes based on the location of the user. Some play music to relax the user's sphincter  (some Inax toilets, for example, play the first few phrases of Op. 62 Nr. 6 Frhlingslied by Felix Mendelssohn). Other features are automatic flushing, automatic air deodorizing, and a germ-resistant surface. Some models specially designed for the elderly may include armrests and devices that help the user to stand back up after use. A soft close feature slows the toilet lid down while closing so the lid does not slam onto the seat, or in some models, the toilet lid will close automatically a certain time after flushing. The most recent introduction is the ozone deodorant system that can quickly eliminate smells. Also, the latest models store the times when the toilet is used and have a power-saving mode that warms the toilet seat only during times when the toilet is likely to be used based on historic usage patterns. Some toilets also glow in the dark or may even have air conditioning below the rim for hot summer days. Another recent innovation is intelligent sensors that detect someone standing in front of the toilet and initiate an automatic raising of the lid (if the person is facing away from the toilet) or the lid and seat together (if someone is facing the toilet).",CAR_0ad500875cd2c110697e64818ac66fd40f31adec,0," The history of drainage, sanitary services, sewerage systems and public toilets takes its place within the general history of public health in Queensland.

The trailer, which runs two minutes and fourteen seconds, features dialogue and scenes that are absent from the final version of the film. For example, at the scene of Jack's first press conference, Yoji asks, have you ever slept with Madonna? During his first meeting with Uchiyama, Jack responds to the demand to shave his moustache by saying, he probably can't even grow one. In the locker room scene where Jack is confused about how to use the Japanese-style toilet, he quips to Max, I need somebody to tell me how to go to the can (later changed in the final version of the film to I need somebody tell me how to take a crap). The music in the trailer is mostly sampled from Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack, but also includes samples from Turning Japanese by the The Vapors.

Similar to powder room, toilet then came to be used as a euphemism for rooms dedicated to urination and defecation, particularly in the context of signs for public toilets, as on trains. Finally, it came to be used for the plumbing fixtures in such rooms (apparently first in the United States) as these replaced chamber pots, outhouses, and latrines.

3,35_1,35,1," <span>Tell me about the history of toilets.</span>"," Toilets accounted for almost 30% of residential indoor water use in the United States in 1999. One flush of a standard U.S. toilet requires more water than most individuals, and many families, in the world use for all their needs in an entire day.A homes toilet water sustainability can be improved in one of two ways: improving the current toilet or installing a more efficient toilet.  To improve the current toilet, one possible method is to put weighted plastic bottles in the toilet tank.  Also, there are inexpensive tank banks or float booster available for purchase.  A tank bank is a plastic bag to be filled with water and hung in the toilet tank. A float booster attaches underneath the float ball of pre-1986 three and a half gallon capacity toilets.  It allows these toilets to operate at the same valve and float setting but significantly reduces their water level, saving between one and one and a third gallons of water per flush.  A major waste of water in existing toilets is leaks.  A slow toilet leak is undetectable to the eye, but can waste hundreds of gallons each month.  One way to check this is to put food dye in the tank, and to see if the water in the toilet bowl turns the same color.  In the event of a leaky flapper, one can replace it with an adjustable toilet flapper, which allows self-adjustment of the amount of water per flush.",CAR_211a0a9aafa83682f475a80ae48345317e90a99e,0," Before the candidate is taken out onto the road, the examiner asks two questions about car maintenance and safety.

Kyoichiro still holding onto defeat tells Shinnosuke he will always be Shocker's lapdog for having Rider 1 and 2's blood on his hands, but Shinnosuke tells him he can always still make up for it. The Great Leader of Shocker's brain appears suddenly and absorbs Rider 3, becoming the Kamen Rider shaped Rider Robo, revealing how he changed history. Drive figures out that the race was allowed to happen so that he could absorb the strongest rider. In its high powered state, The Great Leader threatens to erase the concept of Kamen Rider from history. Every Shocker Rider attacks Shinnosuke, who responds by becoming Drive and attacking them all with his Tire Changes. As they all battle, Rider Robo assaults all the riders. Meanwhile, the children set free Kiriko and Yuto. Gen tries to stop them by becoming Cheetahkatatsumuri, but Deneb appears and fires them off of the scaffolding. Yuto transforms into Zeronos Zero Form, wielding the Denebick Buster. Blade, Chalice, Garren, and Leangle awaken to justice and fight the Shocker Riders. BLACK RX, Mach and Faiz join Drive but cannot take on Rider Robo. However, Kamen Riders 1 and 2 will their souls out of the History Modifying Machine, revealing that they lived in its artificial brain secretly, and waited for the moment they would have the chance to defeat Shocker by escaping through exploiting the machine's revival ability. Kamen Rider 1 and 2 awaken justice in all the Kamen Riders. Cheetahkatatsumuri and General Black, who was Hiruchameleon all along, call on Shocker's most powerful members to join the fight, but Kamen Rider J appears to fight Rider Robo himself. Rider Robo erases J from history with its History Erasing Beam, and does this to all the Legendary Riders as well. Kamen Rider 3 awakens to justice and wills himself out of the machine, destroying its capacity to erase things from history. As Rider Robo still has the upper hand, the Nininngers appear suddenly, offering to take care of it for the Riders. They transform, and Drive is astonished by the existence of flashy ninjas.

Yoshitaka says the ninjas don't have enough Nintality as they struggle with Rider Robo and creates the Tridoron Shuriken, and disappears. Drive uses the Shuriken on his Handle-Ken to form Shurikenjin Tridoron, which makes Tridoron a part of Shurikenjin, allowing Drive to help pilot it. While the other Riders take out the remaining Shocker members, Mach does not make it, but his death inspires the Riders to fight harder to avenge him. Shurikenjin Tridoron in turn defeats Rider Robo with Tridoron Finish, destroying its hold on history. All the Kamen Riders wish Rider 3 goodbye.

In upper-class homes, the first modern lavatories were washrooms with sinks located near the bedrooms; in lower-class homes, there was often only a collapsible tub for bathing. In Britain, there was long a prejudice against having the toilet located in the bathroom proper: in 1904, Hermann Muthesius noted that a lavatory i.e., toilet is practically never found in an English bathroom; indeed it is considered downright inadmissible to have one there.

To keep the two areas separated, shoes are taken off before entering the house so that the unclean shoes do not touch the clean area inside of the house. Historically, toilets were located outside of the house, and shoes were worn for a trip to the toilet. Nowadays, the toilet is almost always inside the home and hygienic conditions have improved significantly, but the toilet is still considered an unclean area. To minimize contact between the unclean toilet floor and the clean floor in the rest of the house, many private homes and also some public toilets have  in front of the toilet door that should be used when in the toilet and removed right after leaving the toilet.

12,35_1,35,1," <span>Tell me about the history of toilets.</span>"," The urinal was built in 1919 and is situated in Russell Street opposite the Toowoomba railway station. The immediate social context for the urinal is to be found in the relevant history of Toowoomba. By the late nineteenth century, the lack of sanitation in Toowoomba became a pressing local issue. Earth closets were in a disgraceful condition and typhoid fever was prevalent. It was in these circumstances that Toowoomba's health program, and that of Queensland generally, began to take shape. Boards of Health were established but no real success was achieved until the first years of the twentieth century. Despite improved sanitary services, Toowoomba had 98 cases of enteric fever (typhoid) in 1916 although by 1918 this had dropped to 17. The foremost mover in these plans was Dr Thomas Arthur Price, public health advocate and mayor of Toowoomba in 1919. The lack of a sewerage system had a major effect upon the provision and type of sanitation, especially for public toilets. Until a sewerage system was installed, all public toilets either had to be in a location where they could be cleaned by a pan service or else operated purely as urinals where the urine could be flushed away to a drain as normal dirty water. A pan service could scarcely be provided in the middle of busy city streets. It is for this reason that women's toilets were located in buildings or some discreet spot, while men could enjoy the use of dedicated urinals in the streets. This was the situation in Toowoomba until 1919. Public toilets with closets were available at the Toowoomba railway station for both men and women and there were a number of iron urinals for men in the streets of the city. These iron urinals were equipped with a water tank for the purposes of cleansing. They operated successfully, but in 1918, the Council recommended their removal and planned better facilities. This is when the new toilet in Russell Street was planned and built.",CAR_8eafc381976e3f39d88be9ef9e32c1c964193a21,0," Despite efforts to tell multicultural histories, history museums have a problem with diversity and inclusion.

Suddenly, herds of forest animals flee past their cabin, followed by two military helicopters, one containing Colonel Abraham Curtis (Morgan Freeman), that announce the area is now quarantined.  They both noticed that the fleeing animals had the same red splotches that they saw on Rick.  Jonesy and Beaver return to the cabin to find a trail of blood from the bedroom to the bathroom, where Rick sits semi-catatonic on the toilet, the room covered with blood.  As Beaver tries to wake Rick, he teeters and falls off the toilet, dead into the tub as a creature writhes and screams in the toilet.  Beaver quickly slams the toilet seat down and sits on it to trap the creature.  As Beaver is trying to take a new toothpick out of his container, he fumbles and all of his toothpicks scatter on the floor.  Beaver is compulsive about his toothpicks and as he tries to reach over and pick one up from the floor, he slips on the blood and falls of the toilet.  A three-foot long lamprey-like creature, with multiple rows of razor-sharp teeth, emerges from the toilet bowl and attacks a disoriented Beaver.  He fights it but the creature kills him just before Jonesy returns from the tool shed with the duct tape.  Jonesy manages to shut the bathroom door, trapping the creature, but he has an eerie feeling that something is behind him.  As he turns around he is confronted by a large alien called Mr. Grey, who turns into a fine red mist, just like the red splotches on the animals and on Rick, and possesses Jonesy's body and emits a red dust around the entire cabin.",CAR_a9601862f56eed3ab59b1324eddd75a8c63ee77e,0,

The Toto product Washlet Zoe is listed in Guinness World Records as the world's most sophisticated toilet with seven functions. However, as the model was introduced in 1997, it is now likely to be inferior to the latest model by Toto, Neorest. The idea for the washlet came from abroad, and the first toilet seat with integrated bidet was produced in the United States in 1964. The age of the high-tech toilet in Japan started in 1980 with the introduction of the Washlet G Series by Toto, and since then the product name washlet has been used to refer to all types of Japanese high-tech toilets. As of 2002, almost half of all private homes in Japan have such a toilet, exceeding the number of households with a personal computer.

A squat toilet differs from a Western toilet in both construction and method of employment. A squat toilet essentially looks like a miniature urinal set horizontally into the floor. Most squat toilets in Japan are made of porcelain, although in some cases (as on trains) stainless steel is used instead. The user squats over the toilet, facing the hemispherical hood, i.e., the wall in the back of the toilet in the picture seen on the right. A shallow trough collects the waste, instead of a large water-filled bowl as in a Western toilet. All other fixtures, such as the water tank, piping, and flushing mechanism, may be identical to those of a Western toilet. Flushing causes water to push the waste matter from the trough into a collecting reservoir which is then emptied, with the waste carried off into the sewer system. The flush is often operated in the same manner as a Western toilet, though some have pull handles or pedals instead. Many Japanese toilets have two kinds of flush: small () and large (). The difference is in the amount of water used. The former is for urine (in Japanese, literally small excretion) and the latter for feces (large excretion). The lever is often pushed to the small setting to provide a continuous covering noise for privacy, as discussed below.",CAR_f1e6576ddb48ced08cd7c0dfef5d436c1f8d02a6,0," The toilet circuit is the network of small music venues in the United Kingdom which rising indie, rock and metal bands often visit to gain support and promote themselves.

For example, the inside of the house is considered a clean area, whereas the outside of the house is considered unclean. To keep the two areas separated, shoes are taken off before entering the house so that the unclean shoes do not touch the clean area inside of the house. Historically, toilets were located outside of the house, and shoes were worn for a trip to the toilet. Nowadays, the toilet is almost always inside the home and hygienic conditions have improved significantly, but the toilet is still considered an unclean area. To minimize contact between the unclean toilet floor and the clean floor in the rest of the house, many private homes and also some public toilets have  in front of the toilet door that should be used when in the toilet and removed right after leaving the toilet. This also indicates if the toilet is in use. They can be as simple as a pair of rubber slippers, decorated slippers with prints of anime characters for small children, or even animal fur slippers. A frequent faux pas of foreigners is to forget to take off the toilet slippers after a visit to the restroom, and then use these in the non-toilet areas, hence mixing the clean and unclean areas.",CAR_41190ffa0b4008c19f5a70a3ae91c8f1fdc43ed9,0," They go on to tell Smecker the events that happened: Right after the MacManus brothers offered a drink and a stool to the Russian mobsters. Rocco, aka The Funny Man, interrupts, telling a joke about the head mobsters mother, in which the mobster replies with a sucker punch that knocks Rocco out. As Rocco lie in pain, Connor and Murphy speak to the mobsters in Russian, as they look on in disbelief, take a shot, then proceed to return the favor, sucker punching the Russian. A brawl ensues, where the brothers and friends, over match and overpower the out numbered mobsters. One mobster is taken out with a couple of liquor bottles to the head. At the end, the main Russian is tied to the top of the counter, while Connor proceeds to pour liquor on the Russians posterior and lights it on fire. The scene ends with the Russian screaming in pain, butt aflame. The next morning, as the MacManus brothers are waking up in their lower class apartment. Two of the Russians, still bandaged from the fight the night before. Come barging in, in pursuit of vengeance. Catching the brothers off guard, guns in their face, they cuff Connor to the toilet, and take Murphy to the alley. Connor, from the fear of losing his brother, somehow is able to pull the toilet from its hinges, and makes his way, toilet still in his arms, to the roof above the alley way. Just as the Russian is about to shoot Murphy. Connor drops the toilet on the Russians head and jumps on the back of the other. When Murphy gets up, Connor now unconscious, he takes a piece of the broken toilet and beats the other Russian over the head until he isn't moving. He grabs their guns, money, and all the other evidence, puts them in a bag, then pulls his unconscious brother over his back and leaves. After they retell their incident to Smecker, he declines to press charges and allows them to spend the night in a holding cell to avoid attention from the media. That night, they receive what appears to be a calling from God telling them to hunt down wicked men so that the innocent will flourish.",CAR_4161623fc95c3810a8f0ea2c2161f2baafc9bfc0,0," At the University of Oxford, following the resolution made by Council on 8 May 2002, Michaelmas Term begins on and includes 1 October and ends on and includes 17 December.

Adonis denies he has killed Brinsley, but is clearly being secretive about something. One afternoon, when he is normally lecturing, Dr. Awkward accidentally meets Adonis in his office and he starts kissing her. However, when Hannah starts scrabbling at his trousers like a deranged dormouse, Adonis stops her and tells her he's impotent. When she tells Albumen about this, he knows something must be wrong, and when they ask Adonis whether he would like to go to a sex therapist, he reveals what has really been going on. As it turns out, Adonis has been mapping human DNA in his secret laboratory for the last few years, and has already started cloning people as well, namely Albumen (a spare one, in case something happens to the original) and himself. Adonis's clone has evidently murdered Sheridan Brinsley, but when the clone comes over to the apartment, no one can tell who is the real Adonis. The real Adonis then tells the police inspector about a microdot he put between the buttocks of his clone in order to tell them apart. This turns out to be a bluff, but it becomes clear that the clone has no genitals (as Adonis puts it: teflon groin) which is convincing enough.

53,35_2,35,2," Tell me about the history of toilets.<br/><span>Where does the term toilet come from?</span>"," It's the last few weeks of the Summer vacation and Elizabeth is getting a bit bored and lonely, so her mother springs a surprise on her in the form of Arabella. Elizabeth is excited but soon finds out she doesn't like Arabella very much and the dislike is mutual, but Elizabeth decides to do her best to hide her dislike, telling herself Be careful, Elizabeth Allen. You're very good at making enemies, but as you found last term, that only makes things difficult for you and your friends. Arabella's a silly, empty-headed doll. You let Whyteleafe deal with her and don't try to cure her all by yourself, Thankfully school restarts soon and Elizabeth won't have to have anything to do with Arabella unless she wants to. As well as Arabella, there are three new students that term; two boys and one girl. Martin seems a pleasant enough chap. Julian is an excellent mimic and very, very clever but he is very untidy, lazy and lackadaisical and Rosemary is a nice girl, but is very timid and weak. Elizabeth soon sees Julian right at the bottom of the form and says Julian, you really ought to try to be top Couldn't be bothered he says Who wants to learn about the tallest mountains? I'm not going to climb them. Who wants to learn history dates? I'll forget them when I grow up, so I couldn't care less. Lessons are pointless and anyway, you're just telling me to work hard because you're a goody-goody monitor. Elizabeth goes to walk off in a huff, but Julian says Oh, c'mon, I'm only teasing. Your friend Joan is in a higher form now, so you won't see much of her for quite a while, so why don't you make friends with me? and Elizabeth does so. At the next meeting, Julian makes a noise like a bubbling saucepan and poor Elizabeth is stuck between a rock and a hard place. She knows she should report him, but he's a new boy and her new best friend. She glares at him and he stops and William says It is not funny to hold up a school meeting and Elizabeth takes the money box round and Arabella does not put all her money in; she keeps a pound to herself and Rosemary gives the game away when she says that peppermint chocolates are such good value. Jenny goes to have a look in Arabella's cubicle and sees the chocolates in her music case Arabella has kept money back and spent it all on chocolates! How mean she tells her form in disgust Well says Harry let's show her what we think of her! I bet at the next meeting she'll put all her money in the box. and everyone gives Arabella the cold shoulder and at the next meeting she says The whole form is making fun of me for no reason that I can see. William asks someone to explain why they're giving Arabella such a hard time and Jenny says Well, William, Arabella kept money back for herself and spent it all on chocolates William consults Elizabeth about it, but she has to say she doesn't really know what Jenny is talking about. Arabella is made to give all her change to Elizabeth and will only have ten pence that week. When the meeting breaks up she says Why didn't someone tell me about Arabella? I felt like a fool! and Jenny explains that she thought Arabella was her friend. One day, Rosemary has to say her money keeps disappearing and no, she hasn't got a hole in her pocket, so Elizabeth marks a coin to see if it disappears and if so, who could have been mean enough to take it and on the next rainy day, the children spin coins and Julian has the marked coin. Elizabeth tackles him over it and Julian denies having stolen it and they split up. Arabella spreads a rumour and Julian plays tricks on Elizabeth to pay her back. In Miss Ranger's class, the books seem to leap off the desk by themselves and Miss Ranger is not pleased Go out of the room, Elizabeth! Once was probably an accident, twice may have been but not three times. You're a monitor and you should know that that sort of behaviour is not acceptable in a class room Elizabeth goes and horror of horrors, here comes Rita I was sent outside, but it was for something that wasn't my fault she explains but Rita says Don't let it happen again. You know that monitors should not do things that get them sent outside. In the French teacher's class, mysterious drops of water fall on Elizabeth's head Ooh she says what is happening? The French teacher thinks Elizabeth is horsing around and says One more sound out of you and you go outside. This is a classroom, not a circus and Elizabeth makes up her mind not to make another sound; she'd rather get saturated than sent outside again. At the end of class, Harry says Elizabeth, how could you behave like that? Let me feel your head. and unfortunately it's as dry as a bone, so Elizabeth doesn't have a leg to stand on. Arabella's birthday comes up and she decides to have a midnight feast and doesn't tell Elizabeth who that night hears a terrific BANG! and when she goes to investigate, she sees Julian with biscuits in his hand Julian she says you're stealing biscuits now! Put them back at once! and in the process makes an awful noise, so the midnight feast has to be cancelled. Julian puts sneezing powder in Elizabeth's French book and she starts sneezing helplessly. She is told to stop and has to say I can't A-TISH-OOOOOO help it and is sent outside again and William comes along, sees her not sneezing there and thinks Elizabeth was just playing a childish prank. She reports Julian for stealing the biscuits, but Arabella explains that they were part of the midnight feast menu and poor Elizabeth realizes that she was wrong about at least the biscuits. William says Elizabeth, you have accused Julian wrongly of stealing and also twice you have been thrown out of the room for playing stupid pranks. That is not the behaviour of a monitor, so you must step down and we will choose someone else in your place. Elizabeth rushes out in tears and Julian begins to feel a bit guilty I know she accused me wrongly of stealing, but she didnt really play the fool in class; her behaviour was really the results of my tricks thinks Julian. Elizabeth is summoned to Williams office and she explains why she thought Julian was a thief. Julian is then summoned and says Oh, I see. A lolly of Elizabeths fell out of my pocket, did it? And there was a marked coin in my pocket? So thats why Elizabeth accused me of stealing, eh? Well, I can now see her point, but I never laid a finger on her lollies or money; someone must have tried to frame me. Anyway, it was not Elizabeths fault she got kicked out of class twice. He turns to Elizabeth and says Elizabeth, I put some springs under your books and that was what made them fly off your desk. I also put some pellets above your head so theyd leak water on you. And I put sneezing powder in your French book. Elizabeth laughs when she remembers what happened, her books flying off the desk in particular and she laughs Youre a real sport says Julian I never thought youd laugh when I told you about the tricks I played on you. Now I like you almost as much as I did before, so will you be my friend again? Oh, yes she says. Elizabeth is a bit mopey and serious for a few days, so Julian plays a trick in the science class and everyone ends up rolling in the aisles with laughter and suddenly everyones friendly again. At the next meeting William says Julian, you should use your brains for work and not just for jokes and tricks. Oh, I couldnt care less about being bottom Julian replies rudely I see says William kindly but I must warn you punishment will come for your laziness and it will, alas be a terrible one Its soon time for the kids end of term outing and Julians mother isnt there yet and Julian reckons the car must have broken down, but he soon finds out the reason for his mothers lateness is far more sinister; shes suddenly very, very ill. Julian races out into the garden and when Elizabeth finds him, he wails My mothers very, very ill; she mightnt live. Why didnt I use my brains for good, worthwhile work instead of only for tricks and jokes? I know my mother couldnt care less about grades, but I wish now Id been top instead of bottom. William was right, punishment was awaiting me and it could not have been a more terrible one. Martin starts to feel very uncomfortable and finally decides to own up that he was the one who was the thief and who framed Julian You horrid thief! she cries You nasty, beastly, rotten, double-faced thief! So it was you who put that coin and those lollies of mine into Julians pocket! Think of all the damage youve done. Because of you I thought that Julian was a thief and I accused him and he played tricks that got me sent outside and I lost my position as a monitor. How could you sleep at night? getting up and walking away. She goes to the music practice room and Rosemary comes in Why were you so beastly to Martin? she asks You know hes so kind and generous and Elizabeth thinks Martin really is a puzzle. How can one person be both kind and unkind; both mean and generous? It just doesnt make sense. The maths class is interrupted by a phone call for none other than Julian and he comes back and says My mums better. MY MUMS BETTER! Miss Ranger lets the class off early; nobody will be able to do any more lessons; theyre too hyper. That night, Elizabeth simply cannot sleep so she goes to have a look at Williams Big Book to see if theres any explanation for Martins strange behaviour and she finds an article about a girl named Tessa who stole things to give to others to win their favour and thats basically what Martin does. Elizabeth confronts Martin and he says I feel simply dreadful, Elizabeth. What can I do to make things better? Well, theres only one thing to do and a coward like you would never do it. You ought to own up at the next school meeting., and lo and behold, just as the meeting is about to break up a voice says Hang on. Ive got something to say and it is Martin William he says I was the one who stole the biscuits, cakes, money and lollies and I planted the marked coin on Julian so everyone would think it was him, not me. I would never have owned up except Julians mother was ill and I hated to think I did that to someone who was so miserable. Also, someone said I was a coward and Im not really Aww thinks Elizabeth look at that. He so badly wanted people to like him and they dont seem to, and now hes had to confess something that will make them dislike him even more. That was a brave thing to do., standing up and saying Well, it wasnt the usual kind of stealing, it wasnt just badness. You see, he stole things to give to people to win their favour. Theres an article in the book about a girl, whose name was Tessa who behaved just like him. Wait a minute and Ill find it., turning to the right page How did you know about Tessa? asks William Well, Martin told me all hed done and I was disgusted she says but all the same, the kids say hes kind and I wondered what made Martin tick, so I looked in the book and found that. Well, Martin says William kindly you cant just buy friends; you have to earn them, so dont steal any more things from your fellows; just be kind, generous and fun to be with and youll soon have more friends than you can count. The meeting finally breaks up and theres only time for an apology from Martin to Julian and a quick dinner. Near the end of the term, Elizabeth gets more than she bargained for on her walk with Julian when some kid falls into the lake. She rescues him and comes back to school dripping wet. She changes her clothes and saunters back to dinner, not wanting any fuss, but at the next school meeting they hear about the heroic deed. It was Elizabeth says Julian it was our Elizabeth Everyone cheers her on and Elizabeth is asked to choose a reward and she says Well, theres a fair on in a nearby town, so could you please let everyone have a few days off to go there? and Miss Best agrees. Julian then stands up and says And please make Elizabeth a monitor again; she deserves it., and his request is also granted",CAR_4d3c60d0abbe206aa001e7d6f4e8dfe076ea17fd,0," And Varun asks for more money and asks them to meet him at the same cliff. Vinnie stole money from her mom's locker. He tried to kill them in the cliff when Sanjana came by searching for Ela and Vinnie. She has seen their video message in which they confessed everything to her. Sanju defended her best friends and said to Varun that he is still the bad guy. If he wants to kill them he should kill her first. Varun hesitated and said he never wanted to kill them just wanted Ela and Vinnie to know that how it feels to come near death.

When Sanju asks him why he was following Sanju he tells that Prithvi has told him to watch her and that he loves Sanju very much. He tells them that Varun knew that Rohan was involved in illegal bike racing so he released Rohan from the jail. Sanju asked him if Prithvi suspected Varun.

According to dialect dictionaries, fixin' to is associated with southern speech and is most often defined as being a synonym of preparing to or intending to. In sentences like (a) fixin' to may mean something like about to or planning to. Sentence (b) expresses more the intention of doing something, in this case the speaker intended to come. However, some linguists, i.e. Marvin K. Ching, regard it as being a quasimodal rather than a verb followed by an infinitive. As can be found in the Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States, the term is used by 57% of the population of Upper Texas and by 43% in Lower Texas. It is a term used by all social groups, although more frequently by people with a lower social status than by members of the educated upper classes. Furthermore, it is more common in the speech of younger people than in that of older people. The term is also more prevalent in rural areas than in urban areas. In addition, the term functions as an indicator for being from the South. As Ching points out, the precise meaning of the term depends much upon its inherent linguistic meaning, which changes in shades of meaning with lexical and syntactic choice. In other words, the term is used in different situations with a variety of meanings. Nevertheless, the meaning is mostly clear to speaker and addressee when used in a particular situation and when both actors are familiar with the term fixin' to.",CAR_4fb09bddef14fcaa1a6849ab7f8fe6daadf340b5,0,"  In plumbing, a closet flange (also known as a toilet flange) is a pipe fitting (specifically, a type of flange) that both mounts a toilet to the floor and connects the toilet drain to a drain pipe.

Citing the example of one of the first written applications of the Arabic term hashish to the Ismailis by 13th century historian Abu Shama, de Sacy demonstrated its connection to the name given to the Ismailis throughout Western scholarship. The first known usage of the term hashishi has been traced back to 1122 when the Fatimid caliph al-mir employed it in derogatory reference to the Syrian Nizaris. Used figuratively, the term hashishi connoted meanings such as outcasts or rabble. Without actually accusing the group of using the hashish drug, the Caliph used the term in a pejorative manner. This label was quickly adopted by anti-Ismaili historians and applied to the Ismailis of Syria and Persia. The spread of the term was further facilitated through military encounters between the Nizaris and the Crusaders, whose chroniclers adopted the term and disseminated it across Europe.",CAR_5e5337e01d10e973b75991a8446430759ed1dccd,0," This type of toilet is also called by many people an ecosan toilet as this name is quite easy to communicate with potential users at the local level.

Mikhail Shah is an arrogant and famous choreographer living in Goa who is also Baby's idol. Through a number of days, Baby is made the manager of Mikhail. Baby also secretly adores and loves Mikhail. She is heartbroken when she finds out that her boss is Mikhail's girlfriend named Nehtra. Nehtra is an arrogant, cunning, and two-timing girl who only knows how to use people for her advantage. Mikhail is making a show called Soulmates about the love of two people named Ruhaan(played by Mikhail) and Aneri. Mikhail has a difficult time finding Aneri although Nehtra wants him to make her Aneri. Mikhail denies saying that she dances with anger, not with love and passion. One day, Mikhail sees Baby dancing and loves how he dances. He tells her to become Aneri, but denies from the fear of her dad. Over some time, she agrees only for one month. This makes Nehtra jealous and tries some tactics, but fails. Mikhail finds out about this and breaks up with her saying she is a mean and sick person. However, one day Baby just leaves back to Delhi which angers Mikhail a lot. It is said that her grandmother was very sick and she is going to be coming back. As she is on the car ride, she gets an accident and gets her legs paralyzed. This makes her unable to dance. Baby becomes negative, cold, and bitter because of this. Mikhail promises to make her dance in a month though. Harry, Mikhail's best friend, thinks that he is running after dreams and hopes that can destroy his career, so he tells Baby to go back for the sake of Mikhail. Baby goes back to Delhi again. Mikhail doesn't know the real reason and starts hating Baby, even though he also starts missing her and developing feelings for her. Mikhail finds out the truth and Baby starts walking again after his therapist, Tarun, makes her watch Mikhail's dance videos. Harry and Nehtra start planning with each other, while Harry still hates Nehtra for using Mikhail and only plans with her for the benefits of Mikhail. Diya, who is Mikhail's best family friend and Harry's girlfriend, sees this and breaks up with him. Harry realizes where he went wrong and apologizes. Mikhail forgives him while Diya is still angry with him. Baby and Harry plan with each other and act like they like each other. Diya realizes she still loves him and goes back to him. They get back together. In this time, Mikhail gets jealous and goes to Baby to tell her to stop. However, Baby tells him the truth and says it was a plan to make Diya realize her love. She then explains how loves is gained and some people love others, but they don't know and by the time they do...it is too late. She indirectly tries to make Mikhail realize how much she loves him. Baby and Mikhail then dance together and spend time together, and then drops her home. Mikhail goes to the dance academy and realizes that he loves Baby. He says, Iska matlab hain ki mein uss idiot se pyaar karta hoon?!? Later on, he tells Harry about this and Nehtra overhears this. Nehtra calls Baby's dad and tells him everything and this is where the problems start. Tarun comes to Goa and tells her that her dad has sent her. She calls her dad and tells him to send him back because she doesn't like him. He tells her that she can only stay in Goa if she gets engaged to Tarun, or else she will have to come back. This shocks Baby and she starts crying as she only loves Mikhail. The same night, Mikhail comes to her doorstep and dances for her. She comes down and tells him that she is getting engaged to Tarun. Heartbroken Mikhail tells her that he loves her and asks her what she wants. She says that she is just listening to her dad, but doesn't tell him why she is listening to her dad. Angered by this, he drives back home. Tarun starts taunting Mikhail saying he has such a beautiful fiancee. On the day of the engagement, Mikhail calls Baby to come with him and she agrees.

Perhaps the most cited explanation is that chocolate comes from Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, from the word chocoltl, which many sources say derived from xocoltl , combining xococ, sour or bitter, and tl, water or drink. The word chocolatl does not occur in central Mexican colonial sources, making this an unlikely derivation.  Another derivation comes from the Yucatec Mayan word chokol meaning hot, and the Nahuatl atl meaning water. The Nahuatl term, chicolatl, meaning beaten drink, may derive from the word for the frothing stick, chicoli. The term chocolate chip was first used in 1940.

His family consists of him, his wife Nayyara(Ismat Zaidi) and three daughters Fala(Madiha Rizvi), Haya(Ayeza Khan) and Fariya(Aiman Khan). They all are well-mannered but middle class as compared to Shaista. Shaista always insults Nayyara and treats her daughters as servants.

Muskaan's father Nasir comes from Dubai with lots of things for her daughters and wife but Zeeshan is fine with it. Iraj likes a bottle of perfume because of which Muskaan is jealous and they start fighting like cats resulting in breaking of perfume bottle. But their mother Shaista is busy looking in things.

She is interrupted by Shaista and she says for a family photo. Naima tells Fala to come but Shaista insults Fala. Afterwards, Shaista calls Haya and Fala for work and gives them spoilt rotis for breakfast.The next day Iraj is talking loudly on her phone in Muskaan's room. Muskaan's phone also rings. It was Danish's call. Because of Iraj's voice, Muskaan cuts the phone and then later Iraj climbs on Muskaan and they start fighting. Their father comes. Meanwhile Danish comes to meet Muskaan and so Shaista calls Fala as a servant. Danish meets Fala and asks her for her reply of Ayaan's proposal. But Shaista says that her mother has rejected Ayaan's proposal. The next day Naima goes to Nayyara's house. Nayyara accepts her proposal of Ayaan for Fala. Zeeshan expresses his feelings for Haya towards Nasir. Nasir is very happy. Nasir says this to Baseer. Baseer is very excited. But Nayyara is not so happy because she thinks Haya will be sad at that home but later agrees. But Shaista refuses to do this. She hates Haya and says that she will never ever be my daughter-in-law. She thinks that Nayyara is taking revenge from Shaista of yesteryears fight which had happened between them during their young days over Nasir.

One is of Haya and Zeeshan and the other is of Fala and Ayaan. Iraj, Muskaan and Shaista are unhappy. Danish and his family visits Muskaan to decide the date of marriage.

She does not listen to Danish and once when her mother-in-law wants to go for a Get Together party, she makes her fun by saying that you are so old still you want to party. She insults her mother-in-law. Fala and Ayaan are happy with each other. But Sulaiman's mother and Ayaan's ex-wife Mariya comes to meet Sulaiman. Naima puts forth a condition that if she wants to meet her son, she has to take him forever. Ayaan and Fala are against it but they have to accept it. Shehryar betrays Iraj and leaves her. Iraj comes back and says the truth about jewellery. Nasir gets a heart attack and dies. His last wish is that Haya should be the daughter-in-law of the house.

Now Shaista's and her children's life has become a living hell. Haya is going to be remarried to her cousin. Zeeshan asks for forgiveness and reacceptance but Haya refuses. Hopes start rising for Iraj when Wahaj comes to takes her back. She goes with him. Meanwhile Shaista goes with Muskaan and Zeeshan in Nayyara's house to talk about Haya. She sees that Haya's rishta is fixed. Shaista is in a complete shock. Muskaan's mother-in-law comes to take her but she insults her by saying that she's doing a Melodrama and tamasha. She calls Danish and says I will come only if you leave your second wife and come to pick her up. He refuses. So, in anger she asks for Divorce. He gives her Divorce Papers. She is shocked.

A prime example of this is vaguada, which is a corruption of the English bad weather, though in Dominican Spanish the term has come to mean storm or torrential downpour, rather than a spot of unpleasant climate. Hence, a common Dominican expression: Viene una vaguada, here comes a vaguada, or here comes a storm. Another excellent example of this is boche, a corruption of the English bull shit, though in Dominican Spanish the term has come to mean a reprimanding, fulmination, or harangue in general terms. Hence, a common Dominican expression: Me echaron un boche, they threw me a boche, or they reprimanded me. The pronoun they in Dominican Spanish often refers to the third person singular, so that me dijeron, they told me, is sometimes used instead of a man told me, or a woman told me, or the young boy by the lemon tree told me. Furthermore, is the Dominican Spanish word for SUV, yipeta, jeepeta, or rarely gipeta. This term is a corruption of the American Jeep, which was the primary mode of transport for the GI's throughout the country during the occupation in the 1960s. Dominican license plates for SUVs are marked with a G for gipeta, a variant of, and pronounced like, yipeta, before their serial number. The word tichel, from T-shirt, also refers to a rugby shirt, association football jersey, or undershirt, and similarly, corn flakes and its variant con fli can refer to any breakfast cereal, in Dominican Spanish, be it puffed corn, bran flakes, or puffed wheat. The borrowing polo shirt is frequently pronounced polo ch.",CAR_866b5345557775902370c1c77205cffc2cd1a429,0," In some  languages, terms with a christening theme or etymology are preferred (e.g. baptme in Belgian French, doop in Belgian Dutch) or variations on a theme of navet and the rite of passage such as a derivation from a term for freshman (e.g. bizutage in French French, ontgroening (de-greenhorning) in Netherlandic Dutch), novatada in Spanish, from novato, meaning newcomer or rookie) or a combination of both, such as in the Finnish mopokaste (literally moped baptism, moped being the nickname for newcomers, stemming from the concept that they would be forced to drive a child's bicycle or tri-cycle). In Latvian, the word iesvtbas, which literally means in-blessings, is used, also standing for religious rites of passage, especially confirmation. In Swedish, the term used is nollning, literally zeroing. In Portugal, the term praxe, which literally means practice or habit, is used for initiation. In Brazil, it's called trote and is usually practiced at universities by older students (doutores and veteranos) against newcomers (caloiros) in the first week of their first semester. In the Italian military, instead, the term used was nonnismo, from nonno (literally grandfather), a jargon term used for the soldiers who had already served for most of their draft period. A similar equivalent term exists in the Russian military, where a hazing phenomenon knowing as Dedovshchina exists, meaning roughly grandfather or the slang term gramps (referring to the senior corps of soldiers in their final year of conscription).

The choice of word relies not only on regional variation, but also on social situation and level of formality (register) or social class. American manufacturers show an uneasiness with the word and its class attributes: American Standard, the largest firm, sells them as toilets, yet the higher priced products of the Kohler Company, often installed in more expensive housing, are sold as commodes or closets, words which also carry other meanings. Confusingly, products imported from Japan such as TOTO are referred to as toilets, even though they carry the cachet of higher cost and quality.

The Suda also stated that the term could be used of a daughter who had living sisters. Although the Suda indicates that in normal usage, the mother of the heiress was also dead, this is incorrect: whether or not the mother was alive had no bearing on the status of the epikleros.

This is a benefit in terms of keeping the costs of constructing toilets very low and allowing villagers to start building their own toilets immediately. However, it can produce two problems: first in flood plains or areas near water tables poorly constructed latrines are likely to contaminate the water table and thus represent little improvement. Second, long-term use of sanitation facilities is related to the pleasantness of the facilities, but dirty overflowing pits are unlikely to be utilised in the longer term. A related issue here is that CLTS does not address the issue of latrine emptying services or where they exist, how they dispose of waste. This has led some researchers to say that the success of CLTS is largely down to the cultural suitability of the way it is delivered and the degree to which supply-side constraints are addressed.",CAR_abfeb7a503e444ab7caf7d533bac121cdd9ce7ba,0," Garifuna is an Arawakan language spoken in Honduras, Belize, Guatemala and Nicaragua by the Garifuna people.

Dry toilets use no, or very little, water; they do not depend on flushing, and so do not produce Wastewater.

In some places, family members would sit on a straw mat in front of the toilet and eat a mouthful of rice, symbolising eating something that the god had left. A properly appointed toilet would be decorated and kept as clean as possible, as the toilet god was considered to be very beautiful. The state of the toilet was said to have an effect on the physical appearance of unborn children. Pregnant women asked the toilet god to give boys a high nose and dimples to girls. If the toilet was dirty, however, it was said to cause children to be born ugly and unhappy. According to a different Japanese tradition, the toilet god was said to be a blind man holding a spear in his hand.

The eighteenth-century euphemism was convenience; the term was further euphemised in the nineteenth century with the term night commode, which John Gloag suggested may have derived its significance from a design for a balance night stool in Thomas Sheraton's Cabinet Dictionary (London, 1803); Sheraton's design was made to have the appearance of a small commode standing upon legs; when it is used the seat part presses down to a proper height by the hand, and afterwards it rises by means of lead weights, hung to the seat, by lines passing over pulleys at each end, all which are enclosed in a case. This appears to be the link between commode as an elegant article of French furniture, and commode as a prosaic invalid toilet. Close stool, in turn, is itself a euphemism for toilet chair .

However, Brooke soon comes to find out that Sylvia is very opinionated and does not like Brooke's tastes, wants, and desires for her wedding, arguing with Brooke on almost every topic, from the bridesmaids dresses to the food to the photographer, and even Brooke's desire to design her own wedding dress. Once her company has officially been sold and she's no longer affiliated with Clothes Over Bros, she takes out her frustrations on Sylvia by saying she doesn't want her money or her input for the wedding and wants to do it her way with her budget, causing a rift between the two, though they later patch this up after Julian tells Brooke that Sylvia's only been acting how she has been acting because she is threatened by Brooke, since Sylvia was always the closest person in Julian's life before Brooke came along. After ruining most of the dishes she tries to cook for Thanksgiving dinner, she attends a large gathering at Nathan and Haley's for the holiday, where she's reunited with a fresh-out-of-prison Victoria, which Brooke is not pleased about at all, nor is she pleased that Victoria and Sylvia seem to be getting along great and bonding throughout the dinner. She later comes to find out that Sylvia was the one who found out about Victoria's release and invited her to dinner hoping that her and Brooke could fix things, but only did so to make Brooke happy, so Brooke tells her future mother-in-law that Julian is the man that he is because of Sylvia's influence and that's all the happiness she needs. After having a bad daydream of her wedding going horribly wrong due to how poor she's become and how bad it will be as a result, she realizes she has no inspiration whatsoever to continue re-planning her wedding now that she can no longer have the wedding of her dreams. While going through some old boxes looking for something to inspire her, she and Julian find the list of things Brooke always wanted to try but never did, which Millie created for her back in Season 6 and includes things such as skydiving, watching every James Bond movie, getting drunk at Octoberfest, learning to speak French, and more, so Julian helps her do almost everything on the list, and afterwards, he promises her that no matter what happens he will make sure that she will get to experience the final item left on her list, which is having a baby. As a huge storm is ripping through Tree Hill, Brooke and Julian argue over him suggesting they move to Los Angeles now that she no longer has her job in Tree Hill, which was one of her main reasons for staying. She accuses him of wanting her to lose her company so that they could move, and blows off steam by going for a drive despite the bad storm. Julian calls her and tells her to come home, and when she says she can't see the road well, he says he will come get her and she tells him where she is, but the call is then cut off when Brooke hits the brakes to avoid hitting someone standing in the middle of the road, which turns out to be Jamie's friend Chuck. She runs out of the car and asks him what happened, and he says there was an accident and points to a flipped SUV on the side of the bridge. She runs over to the car and finds Jamie, Madison, and Lauren, who's still unconscious. As Chuck and Madison wait in Brooke's car, Brooke helps Lauren out of the wreckage and tries to free Jamie as well, who's pinned down by his seatbelt. When Brooke realizes Chuck has a concussion and is having a hard time staying awake, she tells Lauren to use her car and take the kids to the hospital while she tries to free Jamie. Eventually Julian finds them, but right after he arrives, a speeding car dodges a downed powerline in the middle of the road and hits the back of the SUV, causing it to fall over the bridge and into the water with Brooke and Jamie still inside. Julian dives into the water and finds that now not only is Jamie trapped, but Brooke's leg is stuck underneath the steering wheel. Julian tells them the car is not sinking as the wheels are touching the bottom of the river, and the mood calms slightly until the levy breaks and water comes rushing into the car, and Julian is forced to save Jamie first while Brooke is still stuck inside, since Brooke tells him Jamie is just a child and needs help before she does. After getting Jamie out of the car and up to the road, Julian jumps back into the water and finds Brooke struggling to stay above the water, and by the time he frees her, she has lost consciousness and it seems as though she's drowned. He carries her up to the road and begins performing CPR on her, but she does not respond and he breaks down into tears thinking his fiance has died.

It evolved into its present form through contributions from various sources.  The Romans had toilets that conveyed away waste with running water.  In the 1590s, Englishman, Sir John Harington (15611612) contrived a crude flush toilet.

With the onset of the industrial revolution and related advances in technology, the flush toilet began to emerge into its modern form. A crucial advance in plumbing, was the S-trap, invented by the Scottish mechanic Alexander Cummings in 1775, and still in use today. This device uses the standing water to seal the outlet of the bowl, preventing the escape of foul air from the sewer. It was only in the mid-19th century, with growing levels of urbanisation and industrial prosperity, that the flush toilet became a widely used and marketed invention. This period coincided with the dramatic growth in the sewage system, especially in London, which made the flush toilet particularly attractive for health and sanitation reasons.",CAR_e5e2edf69fcc7262687f9dcfb90186b49475b8d3,0,

It first appeared in the fifteenth-century, borrowed from the Middle French term mythologie. The word mythology, (exposition of myths), comes from Middle French mythologie, from Late Latin mythologia, from Greek  mythologa (legendary lore, a telling of mythic legends; a legend, story, tale) from  mythos (myth) and - -logia (study). Both terms translated the subject of Latin author Fulgentius' fifth-century Mythologi, which was concerned with the explication of Greek and Roman stories about their gods, commonly referred to as classical mythology. Although Fulgentius' conflation with the contemporary African Saint Fulgentius is now questioned, the Mythologi explicitly treated its subject matter as allegories requiring interpretation and not as true events. (The word mythologa  appears in Plato, but was used as a general term for fiction or story-telling of any kind, combining mthos , narrative, fiction and -loga -, discourse, able to speak about.) From Lydgate until the seventeenth or eighteenth-century, mythology was similarly used to mean a moral, fable, allegory, or a parable. From its earliest use in reference to a collection of traditional stories or beliefs, mythology implied the falsehood of the stories being described. Although, with its remaining association with sacred tales of the Greeks and Romans, it came to be applied by analogy with similar bodies of traditional stories among other polytheistic cultures around the world. The Greek loanword mythos (pl. mythoi) and Latinate mythus (pl. mythi) both appeared in English before the first attestation of myth in 1830.",CAR_e7fbc6c3963f013defc48d4caa9a6d547a6fc453,0," pejorative term for a German (and, stereotypically, unattractive) woman is niemra, coming from a word Niemka (a woman of German nationality).

A squat toilet differs from a Western toilet in both construction and method of employment. A squat toilet essentially looks like a miniature urinal set horizontally into the floor. Most squat toilets in Japan are made of porcelain, although in some cases (as on trains) stainless steel is used instead. The user squats over the toilet, facing the hemispherical hood, i.e., the wall in the back of the toilet in the picture seen on the right. A shallow trough collects the waste, instead of a large water-filled bowl as in a Western toilet. All other fixtures, such as the water tank, piping, and flushing mechanism, may be identical to those of a Western toilet. Flushing causes water to push the waste matter from the trough into a collecting reservoir which is then emptied, with the waste carried off into the sewer system. The flush is often operated in the same manner as a Western toilet, though some have pull handles or pedals instead. Many Japanese toilets have two kinds of flush: small () and large (). The difference is in the amount of water used. The former is for urine (in Japanese, literally small excretion) and the latter for feces (large excretion). The lever is often pushed to the small setting to provide a continuous covering noise for privacy, as discussed below.",CAR_f1e6576ddb48ced08cd7c0dfef5d436c1f8d02a6,0," Shrinivas a.k.a.

He narrates to him the story. Rao also wants to do a film which will get a Nandi award as he wants to dedicate it to his father. In the opening scene in an apartment in Hyderabad, a girl commits suicide. The case appears to be serious and it is beinginvestigated by inspector Shravan (Shravan) who at first suspects the security, who was the first one to find about the suicide. The next day, the owner of the house (Ali) comes with a babaji who takes the spirit of the girl into a lemon but dies in a car accident on the way back. Then Sreenu tells Ramesh Rao about 3 months later. He also tells Ramesh Rao to imagine himself (Sreenu) in place of the hero.

The both of them become friends during the journey but the next morning, Anjali leaves without Sreenu knowing. After getting down the bus, Sreenu goes to his friend Madhunandan (Madhunandan), and now it is revealed that he had actually come to Hyderabad to meet producer Dil Raju and narrate to him a story he wrote. A house broker (Prudhviraj) gets them a house in the same flat where the suicide took place. After a lot of persuasion, Sreenu agrees to stay there. There he meets Athreya and Arudra (Satyam Rajesh and Shankar) who claim themselves to be assistants of Dil Raju although they are not and began to stay with Sreenu and Madhu. That night, the girl in the bus, Anjali comes there as she thought her friends who used to stay there were still there.

That night, The doorbell rings again but Sreenu does not open the door. Then next morning, he packs everything that belonged to him and runs away from the apartment. It is now revealed that whatever Sreenu told Ramesh Rao till now is his real-life story. Sreenu tells Rao that he just wanted to tell the story to somebody and he doesn't want to actually make it a movie. And saying so, he leaves from there. On the way back, Sreenu encounters a friend of Anjali whose photo he had seen in the room. When he inquires with the girl, he finds out that Anjali had a boyfriend, Madhunandan who was in jail as people believed him to be the reason Anjali committed suicide. At first, Sreenu thinks it is his friend, Madhu but later finds out it is not. Madhu takes Sreenu, Athreya and Arudra to his uncle Shaitan Raj (Brahmanandam), a psychiatrist. Raj helps the three of them and they find out it is just a man (Saptagiri) who has been hiding there as he thought he will get a free house if they also run away. The 4 of them encourage the man to work for a living. That night, Anjali comes there to tell them the truth. She reveals to them that her name is Ushanjali and the one who died is her twin sister, Geethanjali. Geethanjali was in love with Madhu, but her boss, who is surprisingly Ramesh Rao, rapes her after she disagrees to marry him. She commits suicide after he comes out and, Rao interprets as if she hanged herself to the fan, and has Madhu blamed for the death. The gang decide to take revenge on Rao. Sreenu tells Rao that he went back to the flat and the girl's spirit was coming that night to tell him who killed her. Ramesh Rao tells Sreenu he too will come along and hear the spirit. Sreenu and the gang send Ushanjali to Shaitan Raj to take training of the language and body language of devils so that she can act as Geethanjali. That night, at Sreenu's house, Ramesh Rao reveals he knows everything and that the spirit who has come now is not Geethanjali but Ushanjali. In a fit of rage, Ushanjali kills Ramesh Rao by beating him to death and then goes away. Just after she leaves, She comes back in again and tells them sorry for being late and that she is ready. It is now revealed that Ushanjali got locked inside her house after her door got jammed and that the one who came was the real Geethanjali (who escaped from the lemon after it broke open).

All of these, in one way or another, related to improvements to the toilet or associated devices.  The toilet was not the invention of a single person.  It evolved into its present form through contributions from various sources.  The Romans had toilets that conveyed away waste with running water.  In the 1590s, Englishman, Sir John Harington (15611612) contrived a crude flush toilet.  However, Haas' efforts, perhaps more so than those of any other one person, helped transform the toilet from a notoriously unreliable device into the modern commode.",CAR_02d7986bbd451f51afc8a1ff4dbb8dc423567b93,0," The first early multiple rocket launchers were invented in Goryeo dynasty by Choe Mu-seon and in the Joseon Dynasty of Korea, where they were used with great effectiveness against the Japanese Invasions of 1592-98, most notably the Battle of Haengju.",CAR_062ca87f074ad6d6616780e8363a665d3edb7b46,0," Former UCLA professor of information studies, Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News led to the creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have invented the Internet, which followed this interview. Jim Wilkinson, who at the time was working as congressman Dick Armey's spokesman, also helped sell the idea that Gore claimed to have invented the internet. Computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued against this characterization. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet. Cerf would also later state: Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit.

They are flushed by a jet of water from the back that drives excreta into the trap below. From there, the water flow removes it into the sewage system. An advantage of the design is that users will not get splashed from below. Washout toilets have a shallow pool of water into which waste is deposited, with a trapped drain just behind this pool. Waste is cleared out from this pool of water by being swept over into the trap (usually either a P-trap or an S-trap) and then beyond into a sewer by water from the flush. Washout pans were amongst the first types of ceramic toilets invented and since the early 1970s are now only found in a decreasing number of localities in continental Europe. A washout toilet is a kind of flush toilet which were once predominantly used in Germany, Austria and France. It was patented in Britain by George Jennings in 1852 and remained the standard toilet type in Britain throughout the 19th century.",CAR_1daf38375be22486f822b2c3b5411f385a10243c,0," Although paper had been known as a wrapping and padding material in China since the 2nd century BC, the first documented use of toilet paper in human history dates back to the 6th century AD, in early medieval China.
