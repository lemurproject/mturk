Also, in many parts of the world such as India, people consider using water a much cleaner and more sanitary practice than using paper. Cleansing is then performed with other methods or materials, such as water, for example using a bidet, a lota, rags, sand, leaves (including seaweed), corn cobs, animal furs, sticks or hands; afterwards, hands are washed with soap.","CAR_14b05bb8fd2881ce3916ca3049446366918fa21d","0"," A low-flush toilet (or low-flow toilet or high-efficiency toilet), is a flush toilet that uses significantly less water than a full-flush toilet. Low-flush toilets use  or less per flush as opposed to  or more. They came into use in the United States in the 1990s, in response to water conservation concerns. Low-flush toilets include single-flush models and dual-flush toilets, which typically use 1.6 USgpf for the full flush and 1.28 US for a reduced flush.","CAR_18b6e0a00782eb21fcacb8e19ba56a994d2e43ec","0"," Universal released a theatrical trailer for Mr Baseball in the summer of 1992. The trailer, which runs two minutes and fourteen seconds, features dialogue and scenes that are absent from the final version of the film. For example, at the scene of Jack's first press conference, Yoji asks, have you ever slept with Madonna? During his first meeting with Uchiyama, Jack responds to the demand to shave his moustache by saying, he probably can't even grow one. In the locker room scene where Jack is confused about how to use the Japanese-style toilet, he quips to Max, I need somebody to tell me how to go to the can (later changed in the final version of the film to I need somebody tell me how to take a crap). The music in the trailer is mostly sampled from Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack, but also includes samples from Turning Japanese by the The Vapors. The song also appears in the MCA Universal Home Video promotional tape distributed to video rental shops in 1993. Turning Japanese did not appear in the final version of the soundtrack.","CAR_1b3c4a26c711f5d9449c836ed2667a32bd05d9df","0"," The driver of the truck finds and tracks Gene back to the restaurant, where Bob and Linda are on their way to celebrate the dismissal of his ticket, mostly due to how rich he looks in the said suit. The truck driver, who introduces himself as Max Flush, announces that his toilet costs $14,000 and that he's very motivated to locate it. When Gene refuses to tell him the location of the toilet, he stakes outside the restaurant. The kids enlist the help of the Pesto children and Zeke to transfer the toilet in a safer place.

Similar to powder room, toilet then came to be used as a euphemism for rooms dedicated to urination and defecation, particularly in the context of signs for public toilets, as on trains. Finally, it came to be used for the plumbing fixtures in such rooms (apparently first in the United States) as these replaced chamber pots, outhouses, and latrines. These two uses, the fixture and the room, completely supplanted the other senses of the word during the 20th century except in the form toiletries.","CAR_1ffa74ba232814f20bc6cbb5f1ae52e4ecf93643","0","null"
"6","35_1","35","1","<span>*** MISSED HIT ***</span>  <span>Tell me about the history of toilets.</span>"," In Japanese culture, there is a tendency to separate areas into clean and unclean, and the contact between these areas is minimized. For example, the inside of the house is considered a clean area, whereas the outside of the house is considered unclean. To keep the two areas separated, shoes are taken off before entering the house so that the unclean shoes do not touch the clean area inside of the house. Historically, toilets were located outside of the house, and shoes were worn for a trip to the toilet. Nowadays, the toilet is almost always inside the home and hygienic conditions have improved significantly, but the toilet is still considered an unclean area. To minimize contact between the unclean toilet floor and the clean floor in the rest of the house, many private homes and also some public toilets have  in front of the toilet door that should be used when in the toilet and removed right after leaving the toilet. This also indicates if the toilet is in use. They can be as simple as a pair of rubber slippers, decorated slippers with prints of anime characters for small children, or even animal fur slippers. A frequent faux pas of foreigners is to forget to take off the toilet slippers after a visit to the restroom, and then use these in the non-toilet areas, hence mixing the clean and unclean areas.","CAR_41190ffa0b4008c19f5a70a3ae91c8f1fdc43ed9","0"," They go on to tell Smecker the events that happened: Right after the MacManus brothers offered a drink and a stool to the Russian mobsters.

As Rocco lie in pain, Connor and Murphy speak to the mobsters in Russian, as they look on in disbelief, take a shot, then proceed to return the favor, sucker punching the Russian. A brawl ensues, where the brothers and friends, over match and overpower the out numbered mobsters. One mobster is taken out with a couple of liquor bottles to the head. At the end, the main Russian is tied to the top of the counter, while Connor proceeds to pour liquor on the Russians posterior and lights it on fire. The scene ends with the Russian screaming in pain, butt aflame. The next morning, as the MacManus brothers are waking up in their lower class apartment. Two of the Russians, still bandaged from the fight the night before. Come barging in, in pursuit of vengeance. Catching the brothers off guard, guns in their face, they cuff Connor to the toilet, and take Murphy to the alley.

When Murphy gets up, Connor now unconscious, he takes a piece of the broken toilet and beats the other Russian over the head until he isn't moving.

That night, they receive what appears to be a calling from God telling them to hunt down wicked men so that the innocent will flourish.","CAR_4161623fc95c3810a8f0ea2c2161f2baafc9bfc0","0"," 1990  Let Me Tell You About Love  The Judds (Writer)","CAR_41bbe6fab8a0f540b73c672300eebdf74abb5a40","0"," Thin White Girls, like much of Morin's subsequent fiction, is narrated by a young female with a ruthless and unusual sense of humour.

Her brother Zeeshan (Agha Ali) loves her but hates her attitude. The mother and the daughters hate their father's brother Baseer and his family. His family consists of him, his wife Nayyara(Ismat Zaidi) and three daughters Fala(Madiha Rizvi), Haya(Ayeza Khan) and Fariya(Aiman Khan). They all are well-mannered but middle class as compared to Shaista. Shaista always insults Nayyara and treats her daughters as servants. Muskaan goes to her aunt Nayyara's house where she asks Fala to do her Pedicure and Manicure as Fala had done many parlour courses but says not to even do anything to her face as she will do from some another place and tells to wear good clothes during engagement. The family has a cloth sewing business while Haya goes to office. Zeeshan always offers to drop her but she rejects. Shaista comes to Nayyara's house and insults her by giving a cloth and tells her to sew and wear this during Muskan's engagement. She always treats Nayyara's family as her shoe. Muskaan's father Nasir comes from Dubai with lots of things for her daughters and wife but Zeeshan is fine with it. Iraj likes a bottle of perfume because of which Muskaan is jealous and they start fighting like cats resulting in breaking of perfume bottle. But their mother Shaista is busy looking in things.

Nasir goes to Nayyara's house and it is later revealed that he used to love Nayyara in his young time. It was Shaista who had come between them.Nayyara used to like Nasir but Nayyara respects him now. He gives some money to her daughters out of love and Iraj sees this.

She does not listen to Danish and once when her mother-in-law wants to go for a Get Together party, she makes her fun by saying that you are so old still you want to party. She insults her mother-in-law. Fala and Ayaan are happy with each other. But Sulaiman's mother and Ayaan's ex-wife Mariya comes to meet Sulaiman. Naima puts forth a condition that if she wants to meet her son, she has to take him forever. Ayaan and Fala are against it but they have to accept it. Shehryar betrays Iraj and leaves her. Iraj comes back and says the truth about jewellery. Nasir gets a heart attack and dies. His last wish is that Haya should be the daughter-in-law of the house.

Hopes start rising for Iraj when Wahaj comes to takes her back. She goes with him. Meanwhile Shaista goes with Muskaan and Zeeshan in Nayyara's house to talk about Haya. She sees that Haya's rishta is fixed. Shaista is in a complete shock. Muskaan's mother-in-law comes to take her but she insults her by saying that she's doing a Melodrama and tamasha.

A prime example of this is vaguada, which is a corruption of the English bad weather, though in Dominican Spanish the term has come to mean storm or torrential downpour, rather than a spot of unpleasant climate. Hence, a common Dominican expression: Viene una vaguada, here comes a vaguada, or here comes a storm. Another excellent example of this is boche, a corruption of the English bull shit, though in Dominican Spanish the term has come to mean a reprimanding, fulmination, or harangue in general terms. Hence, a common Dominican expression: Me echaron un boche, they threw me a boche, or they reprimanded me. The pronoun they in Dominican Spanish often refers to the third person singular, so that me dijeron, they told me, is sometimes used instead of a man told me, or a woman told me, or the young boy by the lemon tree told me. Furthermore, is the Dominican Spanish word for SUV, yipeta, jeepeta, or rarely gipeta. This term is a corruption of the American Jeep, which was the primary mode of transport for the GI's throughout the country during the occupation in the 1960s. Dominican license plates for SUVs are marked with a G for gipeta, a variant of, and pronounced like, yipeta, before their serial number.

Jim Wilkinson, who at the time was working as congressman Dick Armey's spokesman, also helped sell the idea that Gore claimed to have invented the internet. Computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued against this characterization. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet. Cerf would also later state: Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues.

Arriving in London, she was promptly taken under the wing of socialite Sibyl Colefax, whose drawing room had become a salon filled with the bright young things of the day such as John Gielgud, Harold Nicolson, Nol Coward and notables such as Arnold Bennett, Max Beerbohm and Bernard Shaw. Photos of Loos on the social scene in London appeared in the New York papers, and Emerson's subsequent whisper-throated death bed phone calls managed to inflict guilt on Loos for her absence overseas. Emerson finally joined Loos in London, and to keep his spirits up she took him to the theater every night. It worked: at times he forgot to continue his act and spoke in normal tones. The couple continued on to Paris, where Loos renewed old friendships and made new ones. Emerson's recovery was remarkable. In September, their vacation was cut short; Loos was needed back in New York to do revisions on Blondes for its Broadway debut. Despite them, Blondes closed in April 1927.","CAR_0bb6de4ef86f5e8441db2a840077accbbe0ecd7f","0","null"
