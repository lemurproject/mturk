The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals Do the Reggay was the first popular song to use the word reggae, effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term reggae more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.",CAR_00fc2e1235398f591bdd14bca03a62b2ba03c602,4," Some would say that Mozambique's music is similar to reggae and West Indian calypso.

One very notable influence on African-American names is the Muslim religion. Islamic names entered the popular culture with the rise of The Nation of Islam among Black Americans with its focus on civil rights. The popular name Aisha has origins in the Koran. Despite the origins of these names in the Muslim religion and the place of the Nation of Islam in the civil rights movement, many Muslim names such as Jamal and Malik entered popular usage among Black Americans simply because they were fashionable, and many Islamic names are now commonly used by African Americans regardless of their religion. Names of African origin began to crop up as well. Names like Ashanti, Tanisha, Aaliyah, Malaika have origins in the continent of Africa.",CAR_0545decafa45018d787fa1677f0ffd4bffc6a00f,0,,
1,40_1,40,1," <span>What are the origins of popular music?</span>",HIT number 2 of 34 for question 1,false," Anahid Kassabian separated popular music into four categories; popular as populist, or having overtones of liberation and expression; popular as folk, or stating that the music is written by the people, for themselves; popular as counterculture, or empowering citizens to act against the oppression they face; and popular as mass, or the music becomes the tool for oppression. A society's popular music reflects the ideals that are prevalent at the time it is performed or published. David Riesman states that the youth audiences of popular music fit into either a majority group or a subculture. The majority group listens to the commercially produced styles while the subcultures find a minority style to transmit their own values. This allows youth to choose what music they identify with, which gives them power as consumers to control the market of popular music.",CAR_0e2519bd3736312cac848baf5a5bf300416b2a60,4," Music journalism (or music criticism) is media criticism and reporting about popular music topics, including pop music, rock music, and related styles. Journalists began writing about music in the eighteenth century, providing commentary on what is now thought of as classical music.

Of particular importance was Irish and Scottish tunes, dance music, balladry and vocal styles, as well as Native American, Spanish, German, French and Mexican music. The instrumentation of early country revolved around the European-derived fiddle and the African-derived banjo, with the guitar added later. Country music instrumentation used African elements like a call-and-response format, improvised music and syncopated rhythms. Later still, string instruments like the ukulele and steel guitar became commonplace due to the popularity of Hawaiian music in the early 20th century and the influence of musicians such as Sol Hoopii and Lani McIntyre. The roots of modern country music are generally traced to 1927, when music talent scout Ralph Peer recorded Jimmie Rodgers and The Carter Family. Their recordings are considered the foundation for modern country music. There had been popular music prior to 1927 that could be considered country, but, as Ace Collins points out, these recordings had only marginal and very inconsistent effects on the national music markets, and were only superficially similar to what was then known as hillbilly music. In addition to Rodgers and the Carters, a musician named Bob Wills was an influential early performer known for a style called Western swing, which was very popular in the 1920s and 30s, and was responsible for bringing a prominent jazz influence to country music.",CAR_0ffa51f5c10a80c7afb3f03b1220d5b7c99cb471,4," African blues is a genre of popular music, primarily from West Africa. The term may also reference a putative journey undertaken by traditional African music from its homeland to the United States and back. Some scholars and ethnomusicologists have speculated that the origins of the blues can be traced to the musical traditions of Africa, as retained by African-Americans during and after slavery. Even though the blues is a key component of American popular music, its rural, African-American origins are largely undocumented, and its stylistic links with African instrumental traditions are somewhat tenuous.  One musical influence that can be traced back to African sources is that of the plantation work songs with their call-and-response format, and more especially the relatively free-form field hollers of the later sharecroppers, which seem to have been directly responsible for the characteristic vocal style of the blues. ",CAR_107ead57690f555bab9d7f0dbd204948b6be1248,4," There is evidence that there was a flourishing culture of popular music in Scotland in the Late Middle Ages. This includes the long list of songs given in The Complaynt of Scotland (1549). Many of the poems of this period were also originally songs, but for none has a notation of their music survived. Melodies have survived separately in the post-Reformation publication of The Gude and Godlie Ballatis (1567), which were spiritual satires on popular songs, adapted and published by the brothers James, John and Robert Wedderburn. The only song with a melody to survive from this period is the Pleugh Song. After the Reformation, the secular popular tradition of music continued, despite attempts by the Kirk, particularly in the Lowlands, to suppress dancing and events like penny weddings at which tunes were played.",CAR_120fd4aa79f86a6a0388cb56530c296c3220b6d7,2,,

",CAR_1ceb2d825e5c04cc675e4502639899e6962e6152,0," Scholars have classified music as popular based on various factors, including whether a song or piece becomes known to listeners mainly from hearing the music (in contrast with classical music, in which many musicians learn pieces from sheet music); its appeal to diverse listeners, its treatment as a marketplace commodity in a capitalist context, and other factors. Sales of 'recordings' or sheet music are one measure.  Middleton and Manuel note that this definition has problems because multiple listens or plays of the same song or piece are not counted.  Evaluating appeal based on size of audience (mass appeal) or whether audience is of a certain social class is another way to define popular music, but this, too, has problems in that social categories of people cannot be applied accurately to musical styles. Manuel states that one criticism of popular music is that it is produced by large media conglomerates and passively consumed by the public, who merely buy or reject what music is being produced. He claims that the listeners in the scenario would not have been able to make the choice of their favorite music, which negates the previous conception of popular music.  Moreover, understandings of popular music have changed with time. Middleton argues that if research were to be done on the field of popular music, there would be a level of stability within societies to characterize historical periods, distribution of music, and the patterns of influence and continuity within the popular styles of music.",CAR_1cfdcdf9617a193d150920cdf551a02fcac6aa77,1," The Indian diaspora (and significant portion of other South Asian diaspora) enjoy Indian music, which includes Indian classical music and non-classical Indian music.

The Mandarin popular songs of the Shanghai era are considered by scholars to be the first kind of modern popular music developed in China, and the prototype of later Chinese pop song.  Li Jinhui is generally regarded as the Father of Chinese Popular Music who established the genre in the 1920s. Buck Clayton, the American jazz musician, also worked alongside Li.

African popular music as a whole has been influenced by European countries, African-American and Afro-Latin music, and region-specific styles that became popular across a wider range of people. The genre of music, Maskanda, is popular in its culture of origin, South Africa. Although maskanda is a traditional music genre by definition, the people who listen to it influence the ideals that are brought forth in the music. A popular maskandi artist, Phuzekhemisi, had to lessen the political influence within his music to be ready for the public sphere.

The origins of country music are the folk music of mostly white, working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities.

The availability of inexpensive, widely available sheet music versions of popular songs and instrumental music pieces made it possible for music to be disseminated to a wide audience of amateur, middle-class music-makers, who could play and sing popular music at home. Amateur music-making in the 19th century often centred around the piano, as this instrument could play melodies, chords and basslines, thus enabling a pianist to reproduce popular songs and pieces. In addition to the influence of sheet music, another factor was the increasing availability during the late 18th and early 19th century of public popular music performances in pleasure gardens and dance halls, popular theatres and concert rooms. The early popular music performers worked hand-in-hand with the sheet music industry to promote popular sheet music. One of the early popular music performers to attain widespread popularity was a Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind, who toured the US in the mid-19th century. In addition to living room amateur music-making during the 19th century, more people began getting involved in music during this era by participating in amateur choirs, joining brass bands or playing in amateur orchestras.",CAR_2c80dd6341c22439bcc40147f158b83dfbacbf55,0,,

In such cases (also, that of the Andalusian cadence), explanations offered by tonality neglect the history and evolution of the chord progression in question. This is because harmonic analyses in tonal style use only two scales (major and minor) when explaining origins of chord moves. In exchange, the luxuriant modal system (i.e., the entirety of musical modes ever created and their specific harmonies  if existing) offers various plausible origins and explanations for every chord move. However, most classical (Baroque or subsequent) and popular music which makes use of the given chord progression might treat it itself in a tonal manner.",CAR_48ec9ae4af32d6aaf3f23eb157ae7c84686e4ebc,0," The word ya () was used during the Zhou dynasty to refer to a form of song-texts used in court collected in Shijing.

As such, music that does not use a written score, such as jazz, blues, or folk, can become demoted to a lower level of status. As well, historical musicology has an ideology slanted by the origins and development of a particular body of music and its aesthetic...It arose at a specific moment, in a specific context  nineteenth-century Europe, especially Germany  and in close association with that movement in the musical practice of the period which was codifying the very repertory then taken by musicology as the centre of its attention.

Sales of 'recordings' or sheet music are one measure.  Middleton and Manuel note that this definition has problems because multiple listens or plays of the same song or piece are not counted.  Evaluating appeal based on size of audience (mass appeal) or whether audience is of a certain social class is another way to define popular music, but this, too, has problems in that social categories of people cannot be applied accurately to musical styles. Manuel states that one criticism of popular music is that it is produced by large media conglomerates and passively consumed by the public, who merely buy or reject what music is being produced. He claims that the listeners in the scenario would not have been able to make the choice of their favorite music, which negates the previous conception of popular music.  Moreover, understandings of popular music have changed with time.

Ardrey also argued that aggression was therefore an inherited evolutionary trait still present in man. He challenged the reigning blank-state hypothesis (similarly aligned with cultural determinism), then in currency among social scientists. The blank-state hypothesis was famously defended (and Ardrey was famously attacked) by Ashley Montagu. This debate sparked a major controversy in anthropology and led to widespread popular interest in human origins. It also captured the popular attention and led to increased public interest in human origins.

According to the Cultural Model, the origins of polyphony are connected to the development of human musical culture; polyphony came as the natural development of the primordial monophonic singing; therefore polyphonic traditions are bound to gradually replace monophonic traditions.

The first journal focusing on popular music studies was Popular Music, which began publication in 1981. The same year an academic society solely devoted to the topic was formed, the International Association for the Study of Popular Music.

The corporate nature surrounding popular music streamlined it into a framework that focused on slight deviations from the accepted norm, creating what Adorno calls pseudo-individualism; what the public would perceive as unique or organic would musically comply with standard, established musical conventions. Thus, a duality emerged from this standardization, an industry-driven manipulation of the publics tastes to give people what they want while simultaneously guiding them to it. In the case of rock music, while the genre may have grown out of politicized forces and another form of meaningful motivation, the corporate influence over popular music became integral to its identity that directing public taste became increasingly easier. Technological developments allowed for easy dispersion of western music, causing the dominance of western music into rural and urbanized areas across the globe. However, because popular music assumes such a corporatized role and therefore remains subject to a large degree of standardization, ambiguity exists whether the music reflects actual cultural values or those only of the corporate sector seeking economic profit. Because popular music developed such a dependent relationship with media and the corporations surrounding it, where record sales and profit indirectly shaped musical decisions, the superstar person became an important element of popular music.

The music charts contain songs from a variety of sources, including classical, jazz, rock, and novelty songs. Pop music, as a genre, is seen as existing and developing separately.

Country music is also intertwined with geographic identity, and is specifically rural in origin and function; other genres, like R&B and hip hop, are perceived as inherently urban. For much of American history, music-making has been a feminized activity. In the 19th century, amateur piano and singing were considered proper for middle- and upper-class women.

People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music. In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist. Composition is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music score, which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers.

Early forms of the blues evolved in and around the Mississippi Delta in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The earliest blues music was primarily call and response vocal music, without harmony or accompaniment and without any formal musical structure. Slaves and their descendants created the blues by adapting the field shouts and hollers, turning them into passionate solo songs. When mixed with the Christian spiritual songs of African American churches and revival meetings, blues became the basis of gospel music.

The Tano Indians have influenced the Puerto Rican culture greatly, leaving behind important contributions such as their musical instruments, language, food, plant medicine and art. The heart of much Puerto Rican music is the idea of improvisation in both the music and the lyrics. A performance takes on an added dimension when the audience can anticipate the response of one performer to a difficult passage of music or clever lyrics created by another. When two singers, either both men or a man and a woman, engage in vocal competition in msica jbara this is a special type of seis called a controversia. Of all Puerto Rico's musical exports, the best-known is reggaeton. Bomba and plena have long been popular, while reggaetn is a relatively recent invention.

The lyrics of the song can be rapped or sung, or used combining both styles, as well as danced in both styles. Aguinaldo from Puerto Rico is similar to Christmas carols, except that they are usually sung in a parranda, which is rather like a lively parade that moves from house to house in a neighborhood, looking for holiday food and drink. The melodies were subsequently used for the improvisational dcima and seis. There are aguinaldos that are usually sung in churches or religious services, while there are aguinaldos that are more popular and are sung in the parrandas. Danza is a very sophisticated form of music that can be extremely varied in its expression; they can be either romantic or festive. Romantic danzas have four sections, beginning with an eight measure paseo followed by three themes of sixteen measures each. The third theme typically includes a solo by the bombardino and, often, a return to the first theme or a coda at the end. Festive danzas are free-form, with the only rules being an introduction and a swift rhythm. Plena is a narrative song from the coastal regions of Puerto Rico, especially around Ponce, Puerto Rico. Its origins have been various claimed as far back as 1875 and as late as 1920.

Britain has influenced popular music disproportionately to its size, due to its linguistic and cultural links with many countries, particularly the United States and many of its former colonies like Australia, South Africa, and Canada, and its capacity for invention, innovation and fusion, which has led to the development of, or participation in, many of the major trends in popular music. In the early-20th century, influences from the United States became most dominant in popular music, with young performers producing their own versions of American music, including rock n' roll from the late 1950s and developing a parallel music scene. This is particularly true since the early 1960s when the British Invasion, led by The Beatles, helped to secure British performers a major place in development of pop and rock music. Since then, rock music and popular music contributed to a British-American collaboration, with trans-Atlantic genres being exchanged and exported to one another, where they tended to be adapted and turned into new movements, only to be exported back again. Genres originating in or radically developed by British musicians include blues rock, heavy metal, progressive rock, ska, hard rock, punk rock, Bhangra, electric folk, folk punk, acid jazz, trip hop, shoegaze, drum and bass, grime, Britpop and dubstep.",CAR_ff3bb660c8287414256dcfbe57a11916beae8060,3,"  DANCEROOM MUSIC (noun).

Of particular importance was Irish and Scottish tunes, dance music, balladry and vocal styles, as well as Native American, Spanish, German, French and Mexican music. The instrumentation of early country revolved around the European-derived fiddle and the African-derived banjo, with the guitar added later. Country music instrumentation used African elements like a call-and-response format, improvised music and syncopated rhythms. Later still, string instruments like the ukulele and steel guitar became commonplace due to the popularity of Hawaiian music in the early 20th century and the influence of musicians such as Sol Hoopii and Lani McIntyre. The roots of modern country music are generally traced to 1927, when music talent scout Ralph Peer recorded Jimmie Rodgers and The Carter Family. Their recordings are considered the foundation for modern country music. There had been popular music prior to 1927 that could be considered country, but, as Ace Collins points out, these recordings had only marginal and very inconsistent effects on the national music markets, and were only superficially similar to what was then known as hillbilly music.

Though the work was composed in 1781, far beyond the date music historians have deemed as the beginning of the classical era, it displays many characteristics of the galant musical style characteristic of the pre-classical post-Baroque music of the eighteenth century. Records do not indicate if Reicha began composing the work while he was visiting the cosmopolitan centers of Europe but we may assume that he was indeed inspired by what he heard and saw based on the prevalence of galant musical characteristics presented throughout the work including (1) a simplistic, song-like, and clear melody, (2) short and periodic phrases, (3) a reduced harmonic vocabulary that emphasizes tonic and dominant, and (4) a clear distinction between soloist and accompaniment.",CAR_025349666e4122a965a422d30ad33585619f9a92,4," The dual structuralfunctional dimension of software quality is consistent with the model proposed in Steve McConnell's Code Complete which divides software characteristics into two pieces: internal and external quality characteristics.

One verbunkos tune, the Rkczi March became a march that was a prominent part of compositions by both Liszt and Hector Berlioz. The 18th-century origins of verbunkos are not well known, but probably include old dances like the swine-herd dance and the Hajduk dance, as well as elements of Balkan, Slavic and Levantine music, and the cultured music of Italy and Vienna, all filtered through the Roma performers. Verbunkos became wildly popular, not just among the poor peasantry, but also among the upper-class aristocratics, who saw verbunkos as the authentic music of the Hungarian nation. Characteristics of verbunkos include the bokz (clicking of heels) cadence-pattern, the use of the interval of the augmented second, garlands of triplets, widely arched, free melodies without words, and alternately swift and slow tempi.

The term may also reference a putative journey undertaken by traditional African music from its homeland to the United States and back. Some scholars and ethnomusicologists have speculated that the origins of the blues can be traced to the musical traditions of Africa, as retained by African-Americans during and after slavery. Even though the blues is a key component of American popular music, its rural, African-American origins are largely undocumented, and its stylistic links with African instrumental traditions are somewhat tenuous.  One musical influence that can be traced back to African sources is that of the plantation work songs with their call-and-response format, and more especially the relatively free-form field hollers of the later sharecroppers, which seem to have been directly responsible for the characteristic vocal style of the blues.

If five characteristics of a job are present (skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback), then the employee in that job will experience more internal work motivation, satisfaction with personal growth opportunities, general job satisfaction, higher job performance, and lower absenteeism and turnover. Many studies have provided evidence that job characteristics influence employees behaviors and attitudes.  Additionally, job characteristics can interact with individual differences to impact employee attitudes and behavior. Of these five job characteristics, telework specifically changes autonomy and feedback compared to face-to-face work and can thus influence employees behaviors and attitudes. According to Job Characteristics Theory, changes in autonomy and feedback influence work behaviors and attitudes more than a change in skill variety, task identity, or task significance.",CAR_1218415a9c6da8b4a700994975191dc1278c7b9e,0,,

Sales of 'recordings' or sheet music are one measure.  Middleton and Manuel note that this definition has problems because multiple listens or plays of the same song or piece are not counted.  Evaluating appeal based on size of audience (mass appeal) or whether audience is of a certain social class is another way to define popular music, but this, too, has problems in that social categories of people cannot be applied accurately to musical styles. Manuel states that one criticism of popular music is that it is produced by large media conglomerates and passively consumed by the public, who merely buy or reject what music is being produced. He claims that the listeners in the scenario would not have been able to make the choice of their favorite music, which negates the previous conception of popular music.  Moreover, understandings of popular music have changed with time.

The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are even varying academic definitions of the term genre itself. In his book Form in Tonal Music, Douglass M. Green distinguishes between genre and form. He lists madrigal, motet, canzona, ricercar, and dance as examples of genres from the Renaissance period. To further clarify the meaning of genre, Green writes, Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64 are identical in genre  both are violin concertos  but different in form. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the Agnus Dei from his Mass, K. 317 are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form.

The city's location in the centre of England meant that its music scene was influenced both by the London-based British Blues Revival and by the melodic pop songwriting of Liverpool, allowing it to apply Liverpool's harmonically inventive approach to London's high-volume guitar-dominated style, in the process moving beyond the conventions of both. Birmingham's local jazz tradition was to influence heavy metal's characteristic use of modal composition, and the dark sense of irony characteristic of the city's culture was to influence the genre's typical b-movie horror film lyrical style and its defiantly outsider stance. The industrial basis of Birmingham society in the 1960s and 1970s was also significant: early heavy metal artists described the mechanical monotony of industrial life, the bleakness of the post-war urban environment and the pulsating sound of factory machinery as influences on the sound they developed, and Black Sabbath's use of loosely stringed down-tuned guitars and power chords partly resulted from lead guitarist Tony Iommi's loss of the ends of two fingers on his right hand in an industrial accident with a sheet metal cutting machine.

Bronfenbrenner acknowledges here the relevance of biological and genetic aspects of the person. However, he devoted more attention to the personal characteristics that individuals bring with them into any social situation. He divided these characteristics into three types' demand, resource, and force characteristics. Demand characteristics are those that act as an immediate stimulus to another person, such as age, gender, skin color, and physical appearance. These types of characteristics may influence initial interactions because of the expectations formed immediately. Resource characteristics are those that relate partly to mental and emotional resources such as past experiences, skills, and intelligence, and also to social and material resources (access to good food, housing, caring parents, and educational opportunities appropriate to the needs of the particular society). Finally, force characteristics are those that have to do with differences of temperament, motivation, and persistence. According to Bronfenbrenner, two children may have equal resource characteristics, but their developmental trajectories will be quite different if one is motivated to succeed and persists in tasks and the other is not motivated and does not persist. As such, Bronfenbrenner provided a clearer view of individuals' roles in changing their context. The change can be relatively passive (a person changes the environment simply by being in it), to more active (the ways in which the person changes the environment are linked to his or her resource characteristics, whether physical, mental, or emotional), to most active (the extent to which the person changes the environment is linked, in part, to the desire and drive to do so, or force characteristics).",CAR_5358cd12d0a7b6fcca45a5db60000efc1f815bd5,0," In Texas, ethnic Mexicans who had lived in the area for centuries, played a distinct style of conjunto, different from that played in Mexico.

The corporate nature surrounding popular music streamlined it into a framework that focused on slight deviations from the accepted norm, creating what Adorno calls pseudo-individualism; what the public would perceive as unique or organic would musically comply with standard, established musical conventions. Thus, a duality emerged from this standardization, an industry-driven manipulation of the publics tastes to give people what they want while simultaneously guiding them to it. In the case of rock music, while the genre may have grown out of politicized forces and another form of meaningful motivation, the corporate influence over popular music became integral to its identity that directing public taste became increasingly easier. Technological developments allowed for easy dispersion of western music, causing the dominance of western music into rural and urbanized areas across the globe. However, because popular music assumes such a corporatized role and therefore remains subject to a large degree of standardization, ambiguity exists whether the music reflects actual cultural values or those only of the corporate sector seeking economic profit. Because popular music developed such a dependent relationship with media and the corporations surrounding it, where record sales and profit indirectly shaped musical decisions, the superstar person became an important element of popular music. From the fame and economic success surrounding such superstars, subcultures continued to arise, such as the rock and punk movements, only perpetuated by the corporate machine that also shaped the musical aspect of popular music.",CAR_7065b196e2f4c33c9aa288b543163e5b0364847c,0," Kutiyattam is the only surviving specimen of the ancient Sanskrit theatre, thought to have originated around the beginning of the Common Era, and is officially recognised by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

At best, this explains the selection as a retreat from photographic or classicizing standards for figuration to an older style. Tucker identifies a shared theme of iconoclasm, and a preference for parody and antagonism for her selection, but again, these are qualities common to Expressionism and Surrealism, and even some Photo-realism. A further feature noted is the use of non-high-art sources, the most prevalent being comics. Yet curiously, Tucker makes no mention of Pop Art, as inspiration or opposition. High and  non-high (or low) art cannot be a matter of imagery or iconography, since high-art features as much irreverence and caricature as it does realism and veneration (for example, the work of Goya or Daumier, Lautrec or Arcimboldo). Nor can the difference rest purely upon technique, since paintings may be high or low-art. Yet, comics as a source, along with other commercial illustration cited, surely separates Bad Painting from earlier Expressionism and Surrealism, surely picks out a crucial trait across this otherwise disparate group.

Quantification of a characteristic may have several meanings; however, according to the Free Dictionary it is used for  the act or process of assigning numbers to phenomena according to a rule. Accordingly, quantification of a characteristic means that the set of values of the characteristic is mapped on a suitable set of numbers. In other words, a characteristic is represented by a variable. The rules take care that all the relations like order, distance or a natural zero among the values of the characteristic are preserved within the obtained set of real numbers. An appropriate quantification necessitates therefore that the relations and hence the nature of the characteristic are sufficiently well understood.

Starting in the 1920s, local social dance and entertainment music such as asli, inang, joget, dondang sayang, zapin and masri were adapted by Bangsawan troupes to Anglo-American dance band arrangement but keeping the local folk character, and developed into modern Malay popular music. The Bangsawan troupes originated in the 19th century as a form of opera called Wayang Pasir that developed as an adaptation of Persian theatre brought to Malaya by performers from Bombay.  They portrayed stories from diverse groups such as Indian, Western, Islamic, Chinese, Indonesian and Malay with music, dance and acting in costumes. The musicians were mostly local Malays, Filipinos and Goans.  Famous early singers such as Temah, Tijah and Dean often incorporate Chinese, Middle Eastern and Indian elements in their songs.",CAR_d0602f948817fb81e8d61ee5a84f0fd53a5538a5,0,,

Rock and roll in the 1950s was defined by a driving backbeat, heavy guitars, and lyrical themes that glorified youthful rebellion. Few of Orbison's recordings have these characteristics. The structure and themes of his songs defied convention, and his much-praised voice and performance style were unlike any other in rock and roll. Many of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained musicians, although he never mentioned any classical music influences. Author Peter Lehman summarized it, writing, He achieved what he did not by copying classical music but by creating a unique form of popular music that drew upon a wide variety of music popular during his youth.",CAR_d6a5643cc140a630034f54fa58b970f532f856e2,0," As a result of these limitations, popular music and jazz use a shorthand that describes the harmonic characteristics of chords.

Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive 44 beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalistic, and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. House music initially became popular in Chicago clubs in 1984, pioneered by figures such as Frankie Knuckles,   Phuture, Kym Mazelle, and Mr. Fingers, and was associated with African-American and gay subcultures. House music quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit, New York City, Baltimore, and Newark  all of which developed their own regional scenes.

In addition, the culture and society that a person lives and grows in, heavily impacts an individuals subjective social position.  An individual's subjective social position status depends not only on the objective characteristics but also on how people experience society, the way they perceive their position in comparison with others,and what they imagine their position would be in the future. Lindemann divides objective characteristics into two groups, ascribed and achieved characteristics.  Ascribed characteristics are things like age, gender, and ethnicity.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the  term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.",CAR_f6d332e630063cc0dad352ef993d25b372e2bee7,0," Below is an example of a rhythm pattern characteristic of much popular music including rock presented in standard notation and then its corresponding translation into drum tab.",CAR_f6edb45f482ab59d1b37d3e76e2ac2c6f4b307c8,0," Rock music was not viewed favorably by most traditional and fundamentalist Christians when it became popular with young people from the 1950s, although early rock music was often influenced by country and gospel music. In 1952 Archibald Davison, a Harvard professor, summed up the sound of traditional Christian music and why its supporters may not like Rock music when he said: ... a rhythm that avoids strong pulses; a melody whose physiognomy is neither so characteristic nor so engaging as to make an appeal in its own behalf; counterpoint, which cultivates long-breathed eloquence rather than instant and dramatic effect; a chromaticism which is at all times restricted in amount and lacking in emotionalism; and modality which creates an atmosphere unmistakably ecclesiastical.  Based upon Archibald Davison's statement it is easy to see how different these two genres of music are.  Religious people in many regions of the United States did not want their children exposed to music with unruly, impassioned vocals, loud guitar riffs and jarring, hypnotic rhythms. Rock and roll differed from the norm, and thus it was seen as a threat. Often the music was overtly sexual in nature, as in the case of Elvis Presley, who became controversial and massively popular partly for his suggestive stage antics and dancing. However, Elvis was a religious person who even released a gospel album: Peace in the Valley. Individual Christians may have listened to or even performed rock music in many cases, but it was seen as anathema to conservative church establishments, particularly in the American South.",CAR_f9b824e74087f778150be8ad00028723cc89ebf8,0," The origin of the term Gypsy Punk may be disputable, but it is agreed that the Romani culture is how the style of it began. The Romani people, who are spread out throughout the world, have affected the music industry in the west as seen through bands such as Gogol Bordello. Eastern European and traditional instrumentation and multilingual lyrics are both common characteristics of Romani music. In the case of Gogol Bordello, the upbeat tempo and punk scream-singing along with these common gypsy characteristics create a concrete example of what is known as gypsy punk. The word gypsy coupled with the term punk has interesting implications in that punk encapsulates a particular mode of rebellion, anarchy, and resistance in a Western context which is good to note since at the time Gogol Bordello and other bands were introducing this genre, the punk movement became identified in mass culture as the definitive statement of the annihilation of musical and societal norms, collectively rejecting the rules of the past because of the bleak and hypocritical present and future they provided. This is to say that the Roma that have settled down in the west have taken elements from Romani music in a style that is indebted to Western punk Because gypsy punk is a mixture of traditional music and popular music to the western culture, the Romani are colonizing and seemingly settling into a loose identity of their own. The music itself is considered to be a post-colonial movement.",CAR_fa17d095472b9c24cbc9e5cd1b62a63779d0351e,0,,

Art songs require strong vocal technique, understanding of language, diction and poetry for interpretation. Though such singers may also perform popular or folk songs on their programs, these characteristics and the use of poetry are what distinguish art songs from popular songs. Art songs are a tradition from most European countries, and now other countries with classical music traditions. German-speaking communities use the term art song (Kunstlied) to distinguish so-called serious compositions from folk song (Volkslied). The lyrics are often written by a poet or lyricist and the music separately by a composer. Art songs may be more formally complicated than popular or folk songs, though many early Lieder by the likes of Franz Schubert are in simple strophic form. The accompaniment of European art songs is considered as an important part of the composition.

Sales of 'recordings' or sheet music are one measure.  Middleton and Manuel note that this definition has problems because multiple listens or plays of the same song or piece are not counted.  Evaluating appeal based on size of audience (mass appeal) or whether audience is of a certain social class is another way to define popular music, but this, too, has problems in that social categories of people cannot be applied accurately to musical styles. Manuel states that one criticism of popular music is that it is produced by large media conglomerates and passively consumed by the public, who merely buy or reject what music is being produced. He claims that the listeners in the scenario would not have been able to make the choice of their favorite music, which negates the previous conception of popular music.  Moreover, understandings of popular music have changed with time. Middleton argues that if research were to be done on the field of popular music, there would be a level of stability within societies to characterize historical periods, distribution of music, and the patterns of influence and continuity within the popular styles of music.",CAR_1cfdcdf9617a193d150920cdf551a02fcac6aa77,3," Information provided about Characteristic: Tags: Hindi meaning of Characteristic, Characteristic meaning in hindi, Characteristic ka matalab hindi me, Characteristic translation and definition in Hindi language.",MARCO_1018931,0," GEOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS Each place has distinctive characteristics that distinguishes it from other places.

The 18th-century origins of verbunkos are not well known, but probably include old dances like the swine-herd dance and the Hajduk dance, as well as elements of Balkan, Slavic and Levantine music, and the cultured music of Italy and Vienna, all filtered through the Roma performers. Verbunkos became wildly popular, not just among the poor peasantry, but also among the upper-class aristocratics, who saw verbunkos as the authentic music of the Hungarian nation. Characteristics of verbunkos include the bokz (clicking of heels) cadence-pattern, the use of the interval of the augmented second, garlands of triplets, widely arched, free melodies without words, and alternately swift and slow tempi. By the end of the 18th century, verbunkos was in use in opera, chamber and piano music, and in song literature, and was regarded as the continuation, the resurrection of ancient Hungarian dance and music, and its success signified the triumph of the people's art.",CAR_0af7597199b7976120f1b3c3962db220365dcac7,4," Characteristics vs. Navigational Attributes.

The term may also reference a putative journey undertaken by traditional African music from its homeland to the United States and back. Some scholars and ethnomusicologists have speculated that the origins of the blues can be traced to the musical traditions of Africa, as retained by African-Americans during and after slavery. Even though the blues is a key component of American popular music, its rural, African-American origins are largely undocumented, and its stylistic links with African instrumental traditions are somewhat tenuous.  One musical influence that can be traced back to African sources is that of the plantation work songs with their call-and-response format, and more especially the relatively free-form field hollers of the later sharecroppers, which seem to have been directly responsible for the characteristic vocal style of the blues.

The field of pop music developed tremendously during this period, as the increasingly low price of recorded music stimulated demand and greater profits for the record industry.  As a result, music marketing became more and more prominent, resulting in a number of mainstream pop stars whose popularity was previously unheard of.  Many of the first such stars were Italian-American crooners like Dean Martin, Rudy Vallee, Tony Bennett, Perry Como, Frankie Laine and, most famously, the first pop vocalist to engender hysteria among his fans Frank Sinatra. The era of the modern teen pop star, however, began in the 1960s. Bubblegum pop groups like The Monkees were chosen entirely for their appearance and ability to sell records, with no regard to musical ability.  The same period, however, also saw the rise of new forms of pop music that achieved a more permanent presence in the field of American popular music, including rock, soul and pop-folk. By the end of the 1960s, two developments had completely changed popular music: the birth of a counterculture, which explicitly opposed mainstream music, often in tandem with political and social activism, and the shift from professional composers to performers who were both singers and songwriters.",CAR_0c5d4aaaf35a86e8a14d4b31198b41bac4d010c6,3," Assistive technology is used at Landmark College to facilitate academic skill development and to enable students to fully access course materials.

These technologies can be classified under two general categories: non-evolution-based and evolution-based DEL technologies capable of molecular evolution. The first category benefits from the ability to use off the shelf reagents and therefore enables rather straightforward library generation. Hits can be identified by DNA sequencing, however DNA translation and therefore molecular evolution is not feasible by these methods. The split and pool approaches developed by researchers at Praecis Pharmaceuticals (now owned by GlaxoSmithKline), Nuevolution (Copenhagen, Denmark) and ESAC technology developed in the laboratory of Prof D. Neri (Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, Zurich, Switzerland) fall under this category. ESAC technology sets itself apart being a combinatorial self-assembling approach which resembles fragment based hit discovery (Fig 1b). Here DNA annealing enables discrete building block combinations to be sampled, but no chemical reaction takes place between them. Examples of evolution-based DEL technologies are DNA-routing developed by Prof. D.R. Halpin and Prof. P.B. Harbury (Stanford University, Stanford, CA), DNA-templated synthesis developed by Prof. D. Liu (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA) and commercialized by Ensemble Therapeutics (Cambridge, MA) and YoctoReactor technology.  developed and commercialized by Vipergen (Copenhagen, Denmark). These technologies are described in further detail below. DNA-templated synthesis and YoctoReactor technology require the prior conjugation of chemical building blocks (BB) to a DNA oligonucleotide tag before library assembly, therefore more upfront work is required before library assembly. Furthermore, the DNA tagged BBs enable the generation of a genetic code for synthesized compounds and artificial translation of the genetic code is possible: That is the BBs can be recalled by the PCR-amplified genetic code, and the library compounds can be regenerated. This, in turn, enables the principle of Darwinian natural selection and evolution to be applied to small molecule selection in direct analogy to biological display systems; through rounds of selection, amplification and translation.",CAR_163054b332010e8ba6518a9ee77b7ed2334acace,0,,

Sales of 'recordings' or sheet music are one measure.  Middleton and Manuel note that this definition has problems because multiple listens or plays of the same song or piece are not counted.  Evaluating appeal based on size of audience (mass appeal) or whether audience is of a certain social class is another way to define popular music, but this, too, has problems in that social categories of people cannot be applied accurately to musical styles. Manuel states that one criticism of popular music is that it is produced by large media conglomerates and passively consumed by the public, who merely buy or reject what music is being produced. He claims that the listeners in the scenario would not have been able to make the choice of their favorite music, which negates the previous conception of popular music.  Moreover, understandings of popular music have changed with time.

The limitations of existing electronic music components meant that in many cases each note or tone had to be recorded separately, with changes in pitch often achieved by speeding up or slowing down the tape, and then splicing or overdubbing the result into the master tape. These tape-recorded electronic works could be extremely laborious and time-consuming to createaccording to the 1967 Moog 900 Series demonstration record, such recordings could have as many as eight edits per inch of tape.

New technologies are developed and co-exist with the old before supplanting them. Transport offers several examples; from sailing to steam ships to automobiles replacing horse-based transportation. Technological transitions (TT) describe how these technological innovations occur and are incorporated into society. Alongside the technological developments TT considers wider societal changes such as user practices, regulation, industrial networks (supply, production, distribution), infrastructure, and symbolic meaning or culture. For a technology to have use, it must be linked to social structures human agency and organisations to fulfil a specific need. Hughes refers to the seamless web where physical artefacts, organisations, scientific communities, and social practices combine.

Generally, other than an urge for a technological achievement, the major driving force for such an effort is competition from other modes of transport. Competition between different service providers within a mode of transport does not typically lead to such technological investments to increase the speed.  Instead, the service providers prefer to compete in service quality and cost. An example of this phenomenon is high-speed rail. The speed limit of rail transport had been pushed so hard to enable it to effectively compete with road and air transport. But this achievement was not done for different rail operating companies to compete between themselves. This phenomenon also reduces the airline desirability of SSTs, because, in very long distances (a couple of thousands of kilometers), competition between different modes of transport is rather like a single-horse race: air transport does not have a significant competitor. The only competition is between the airline companies, and they would rather pay to reduce cost and increase service quality than an expensive speed increase.",CAR_3b1a1e8263f19bf8a9cbb940bc33172ec913eba8,0," In 1989 Stuart Parkin discovered the phenomenon of oscillatory interlayer coupling in magnetic multilayers, by which magnetic layers are magnetically coupled via an intervening non magnetic metallic spacer layer.  Parkin found that the sign of the exchange coupling oscillates from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic with an oscillation period of just a few atomic layers. Remarkably, Parkin discovered this phenomenon ih thin film magnetic heterostructures that he prepared in a simple home-made sputtering system. Parkin, moreover, showed that this phenomenon is displayed by almost all metalllic transition elements. In what is often referred to as Parkin's Periodic Table, Parkin showed that the strength of this oscillatory interlayer exchange interaction varied systematically across the Periodic Table of the elements.  Parkin made numerous other fundamental discoveries which led to the development of the field of spintronics of which he is widely recognized as the foremost scientist.  Parkin invented the spin-valve sensor which is based on Parkin's fundamental discoveries including his discovery and unravelling of the origin of the so-called giant magnetoresistance effect.  Parkin showed, in contrast to the claims of Albert Fert, that this effect is derived from spin dependent scattering at the interfaces between magnetic and non-magnetic layers in magnetic heterostructures.  It is only because that the magnetoresistance is derived from interface scattering is it technologically important. Parkin invented the spinvalve magnetic field sensing device.  This led to IBM's development of the spin-valve read head, which enabled a more than 1000-fold increase in magnetic hard disk drive ",CAR_3baaa4ed317fd87b96ad4753ee5b2622f10d7fdf,0," Moog synthesizer (pronounced  ; often anglicized to  , though Robert Moog preferred the former) may refer to any number of analog synthesizers designed by Robert Moog or manufactured by Moog Music, and is commonly used as a generic term for older-generation analog music synthesizers.  The Moog company pioneered the commercial manufacture of modular voltage-controlled analog synthesizer systems in the mid 1960s.

Around 250 stereo tape recordings were made during this period (of which only three have survived), but the technology remained a closely guarded secret within Germany until the end of World War II. After the war, American audio engineer John T. Mullin and the Ampex corporation pioneered the commercial development of tape recording in the USA, and the technology was rapidly taken up by radio and the music industry due to its superior sound fidelity and because tape - being a linear recording medium - could be easily edited, by physically cutting and splicing the tape, to remove unwanted elements and create a 'perfect' recording. 2-track tape recording was rapidly adopted for modern music in the 1950s because it enabled signals from two or more separate microphones to be recorded simultaneously, enabling stereophonic recordings to be made and edited conveniently, which in turn facilitated the rapid expansion of the consumer high-fidelity (HiFi) market.

The technology was invented in the 1930s, but remained restricted to Germany (where it was widely used in broadcasting) until the end of World War II. Magnetic tape provided another dramatic leap in audio fidelity  indeed, Allied observers first became aware of the existence of the new technology because they noticed that the audio quality of obviously pre-recorded programs was practically indistinguishable from live broadcasts. From 1950 onwards, magnetic tape quickly became the standard medium of audio master recording in the radio and music industries, and led to the development of the first hi-fi stereo recordings for the domestic market, the development of multi-track tape recording for music, and the demise of the disc as the primary mastering medium for sound. Magnetic tape also brought about a radical reshaping of the recording process  it made possible recordings of far longer duration and much higher fidelity than ever before, and it offered recording engineers the same exceptional plasticity that film gave to cinema editors  sounds captured on tape could now easily be manipulated sonically, edited, and combined in ways that were simply impossible with disc recordings. These experiments reached an early peak in the 1950s with the recordings of Les Paul and Mary Ford, who pioneered the use of tape editing and multi-tracking to create large 'virtual' ensembles of voices and instruments, constructed entirely from multiple taped recordings of their own voices and instruments. Magnetic tape fueled a rapid and radical expansion in the sophistication of popular music and other genres, allowing composers, producers, engineers and performers to realize previously unattainable levels of complexity. Other concurrent advances in audio technology led to the introduction of a range of new consumer audio formats and devices, on both disc and tape, including the development full-frequency-range disc reproduction, the change from shellac to polyvinyl plastic for disc manufacture, the invention of the 33rpm, 12-inch long-playing (LP) disc and the 45rpm 7-inch single, the introduction of domestic and professional portable tape recorders (which enabled high-fidelity recordings of live performances), the popular 4-track cartridge and compact cassette formats, and even the world's first sampling keyboards - the pioneering tape-based keyboard instrument the Chamberlin, and its more famous successor, the Mellotron.",CAR_68099489764175c6af6440be736383cb3a381367,1," Mixman Technologies, Inc. was founded in 1994 by Josh Gabriel and Eric Almgren. The mission was to create powerful but easy-to-use interactive music creation tools that enabled the user to make and perform the music with actual digital song elements of their favorite artist and musical styles of passion. Gabriels original concept came from a machine he developed performing dance music in clubs while in college. The machine generated light beams and as the dancerperformer broke the light beams with his hands, musical elements were triggered and played in a synchronized music mix. The real time performance nature of this original idea remains as the fundamental uniqueness of Mixman software today.

Algorithms and protocols that are part of such platforms prompt users activities and online experiences on social media platforms. One of the most prominent activities on social media includes sharing and as Kennedy argues, sharing rhetoric draws on a cultural image of connectivity. Social media platforms are not the only actors to use such imagining, mobile-based platforms do the same. Network providers, handset manufacturers, and social media platforms each promote social activities of togetherness enabled by their products which evidences a sustained cultural norm of sharing through teletechnologies for the purpose of affective connectivity. Therefore, such architecture creates even bigger demand in connectivity that is continuously exploited by the online market.

The corporate nature surrounding popular music streamlined it into a framework that focused on slight deviations from the accepted norm, creating what Adorno calls pseudo-individualism; what the public would perceive as unique or organic would musically comply with standard, established musical conventions. Thus, a duality emerged from this standardization, an industry-driven manipulation of the publics tastes to give people what they want while simultaneously guiding them to it. In the case of rock music, while the genre may have grown out of politicized forces and another form of meaningful motivation, the corporate influence over popular music became integral to its identity that directing public taste became increasingly easier. Technological developments allowed for easy dispersion of western music, causing the dominance of western music into rural and urbanized areas across the globe. However, because popular music assumes such a corporatized role and therefore remains subject to a large degree of standardization, ambiguity exists whether the music reflects actual cultural values or those only of the corporate sector seeking economic profit. Because popular music developed such a dependent relationship with media and the corporations surrounding it, where record sales and profit indirectly shaped musical decisions, the superstar person became an important element of popular music. From the fame and economic success surrounding such superstars, subcultures continued to arise, such as the rock and punk movements, only perpetuated by the corporate machine that also shaped the musical aspect of popular music.",CAR_7065b196e2f4c33c9aa288b543163e5b0364847c,2,,

The field of pop music developed tremendously during this period, as the increasingly low price of recorded music stimulated demand and greater profits for the record industry.  As a result, music marketing became more and more prominent, resulting in a number of mainstream pop stars whose popularity was previously unheard of.  Many of the first such stars were Italian-American crooners like Dean Martin, Rudy Vallee, Tony Bennett, Perry Como, Frankie Laine and, most famously, the first pop vocalist to engender hysteria among his fans Frank Sinatra. The era of the modern teen pop star, however, began in the 1960s. Bubblegum pop groups like The Monkees were chosen entirely for their appearance and ability to sell records, with no regard to musical ability.  The same period, however, also saw the rise of new forms of pop music that achieved a more permanent presence in the field of American popular music, including rock, soul and pop-folk.

One is informed by cognitive and language processing theories such as cognitive psychology, psycholinguistics, schema theory, metacognition, constructivism, and other similar theories. This orientation includes a particular focus on examining the cognitive and social processes involved in comprehending online or digital texts (see for example: Leu, 2001; Leu, Kinzer, Coiro, & Cammack, 2004; Coiro, 2003; Coiro & Dobler, 2007). Donald Leu, a prominent researcher in the field of new literacies, has outlined four defining characteristics of new literacies, according to a largely psycholinguistic orientation (see: Leu et al., 2007). First, new technologies (such as the internet) and the novel literacy tasks that pertain to these new technologies require new skills and strategies to effectively use them. Second, new literacies are a critical component of full participationcivic, economic, and personalin our increasingly global society. A third component to this approach is new literacies are deicticthat is, they change regularly as new technology emerges and older technologies fade away. With this in mind, what may be important in reading instruction and literacy education is not to teach any single set of new literacies, but rather to teach students how to learn continuously new literacies that will appear during their lifetime. Finally, new literacies are multiple, multimodal, and multifaceted, and as such, multiple points of view will be most beneficial in attempting to comprehensively analyze them. This orientation makes a distinction between New Literacies and new literacies theories. Lower case theories are better able to keep up with the rapidly changing nature of literacy in a deictic world since they are closer to the specific types of changes that are taking place and interest those who study them within a particular heuristic. Lower case theories also permit the field to maximize the lenses that are used and the technologies and contexts that are studied. This position argues that every scholar who studies new literacy issues is generating important insights for everyone else, even if they do not share a particular lens, technology, or context; and that this requires a second level of theorising. New Literacies (capitalized), it is argued, is a broader, more inclusive concept, and includes common findings emerging across multiple, lower case theories.  New Literacies theory benefits from work taking place in the multiple, lower case dimensions of new literacies by looking for what appear to be the most common and consistent patterns being found in lower case theories and lines of research. This approach permits everyone to fully explore their unique, lowercase perspective of new literacies, allowing scholars to maintain close focus on many different aspects of the rapidly shifting landscape of literacy during a period of rapid change.  At the same time, each also benefits from expanding their understanding of other, lowercase, new literacies perspectives. By assuming change in the model, everyone is open to a continuously changing definition of literacy, based on the most recent data that emerges consistently, across multiple perspectives, disciplines, and research traditions. Moreover, areas in which alternative findings emerge are identified, enabling each to be studied again, from multiple perspectives.  From this process, common patterns emerge and are included in a broader, common, New Literacies theory. From this orientation, proponents argue, this process enables a particular theorization of New Literacies to keep up with consistent elements that will always define literacy on the Internet while it also informs each of the lower case theories of new literacies with patterns that are being regularly found by others.",CAR_8cce3234736609d0cfc8467c5b0c80cb743f93f5,0," SIM's new technology was meant to lead to the development of telescopes powerful enough to take images of Earth-like extrasolar planets orbiting distant stars and to determine whether those planets are able to sustain life.

What one experiences is mere appearance; one must dig beneath this appearance in order to communicate with the heart and soul of what lies hidden within it. The Doctrine of Hsin-Hsing The doctrine that the manifesto claims is most neglected by Western Sinologists is the concentration of mind on an exhaustive study of the nature of the universe.  This is the basis of all theories related to Chinese culture, and with a full grasp of Hsin-Hsing (literally mind-nature; xinxing ) one is able to understand the successes and limitations of Chinese culture. This doctrine allows for a development of the Chinese moral subject in harmony with the universe; but also displays the lack of development in the political subject, the knowing subject, and the technological subject in relation to the West. The rationale behind this is the differences in history between China and its Western counterparts. Western society has pluralistic origins in Greek reason, Hebrew faith, and Roman Law, while Chinas culture emphasizes on yiben  or one foundation. This changes the values associated with each culture, as China focuses more on the development of moral individuals it places less importance on competition and technological progress in comparison with the West. To truly study Sinology the manifesto states that the researcher must  study this one foundation or Hsin-Hsin to experience the culture as a living, objective being. After this understanding is achieved, the limitations of Chinese culture are uncovered along with the successes. The New Approach does not all together denounce Western culture. It urges the Chinese to learn Western systems of logic, natural sciences, technological advances, and institutions of democratic government. The synthesis of the cultures requires a respectful learning and appreciation of what each has to offer in order to better both sides of the world.",CAR_9d653b40933dda1daeb4e29d26278ea53f525957,0," The essays in File Under Popular tackle the subject of popular music, what it is, its origins and the political and marketing forces behind it.

The second stage is the era of technological transfer from one region or society to others, for example, the dissemination of Edisons electric system from New York City to other cities such as London and Berlin. The third phase of systemic evolution is marked by a period of system growth and expansion when the technological system strives to improve its performance, for instance with respect to economic outcomes or output efficiency. In this phase, the system is dependent on the satisfactory evolution of all its components performances. The development of the technological systems is therefore reliant on the reciprocated and interdependent cause and effect processes amongst social and technical components, and may be described as co-evolutionary, where the balanced co-evolution of system components carries significance in establishing desired system progress.

At the time of his first publication 2 on fluorescence microscopy using epi illumination with narrow-band blue and green light, he was not aware of the development of a dichroic beam splitter for UV excitation with incident light by Brumberg and Krylova 1. Neither was the Leitz company, Soon it became clear that excitation with narrow-band blue and green light opened optimal possibilities for the detection of the widely used immunofluorescence labels fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) 3. The use of blue and green excitation also minimized autofluorescence of tissue components an undesired effect encountered with conventional transmitted illumination with UV light. FITC could now be excited with narrow band blue light (using a band interference filter with a half width of 16 nm), close to the excitation maximum at 490 nm (long wavelength blue), with clear observation of the green fluorescence peak emission at 520 nm. Autofluorescence of tissue components was minimized (Fig. 2a, b) resulting in a high image contrast 4. Excitation of FITC near its excitation maximum enabled such an efficient excitation that even a mercury high-pressure arc lamp, having no strong emission peak in the blue wavelength range, could be used 5. Furthermore, epi-illumination with a green reflecting dichroic mirror enabled for the first time the excitation of Feulgen pararosaniline with the strong mercury emission line at 546 nm. In his second publication on the multi-wavelengths epi-illuminator 3, describing a Leitz prototype with four dichroic beam-splitters, Ploem could acknowledge the contribution of Brumberg and Krylova 1. The inaccessibility of Russian research in that time period, and the absence of any major industrial development of epi-fluorescence microscopy in Russia or East Germany was the reason that Leitz and Zeiss had not been aware earlier of such a development. The possibility to introduce epi-illumination with UV light, although useful for several applications, had not been a motive for a new technological development at Leitz, since they had already excellent transmitted dark field UV excitation available. Subsequently Leitz developed a novel multi-wavelength fluorescence epi-illuminator (Leitz PLOEMOPAK) with four rotating dichroic beamsplitters for respectively UV, violet, blue and green light. In successive generations of Leitz illuminators (containing four dichroic beamsplitters) barrier filters and a rotating turret for excitation filters were added 3,6.7. Finally an elegant epi-illuminator was constructed by Kraft 8 containing multiple sets of a combination of an excitation filter, a dichroic beamsplitter and a barrier or emission filter, mounted together in a filter cube, also called filter block (Fig. 4). Since this illuminator permitted the filter cubes to be rapidly turned into the optical light path, multi-wavelength illumination of the same section of tissue became a practical proposition. Moreover, the four filter cubes in the illuminator could be exchanged by the user (Fig 1). Different sets of four filter cubes could be assembled, chosen from many filter cubes, containing combinations of excitation, barrier filters and dichroic beamsplitters, developed for different applications. The increasing worldwide use of routine immunofluorescence microscopy in medical diagnosis and molecular biology research could, however, profit from the new possibility @9 of epi-illumination permitting using narrow band excitation with blue and green light 9 . An important step for studies with live cells, was the design by Ploem of the first inverted fluorescence microscope with a multi wavelength epi illuminator under the microscope stage.. This provides free working stage above the microscope stage for eventual manipulation of the cells. . Following these suggestions by Ploem, Leitz also manufactured an inverted microscope with epi-illumination.",CAR_c3a59408382fd8b9c7bedfe86c81e95ce00916d9,0," A major aspect of the post-network era has been the development of new technologies that change the ways in which television is consumed and distributed.

By the late 1930s, music librarianship was recognized as a new frontier.  Fifteen years earlier (1923), the field of musicology, as an academic vocation, was also a new discipline.  Many credit Otto Kinkeldey as not only being among the first musicologists, but also, in 1937, the first to propose music librarianship, not only as field of study at the university level, but also as a full-time vocation requiring expertise on par with PhDs.",CAR_cfa6702cbeb3af6f5ad6f7c6c8314e70046baad2,3," Malaysian popular music has its origin in local musical tradition and popular European music styles. Some of the early musical styles, performers, and songs of Kroncong and lagu-lagu rakyat (folk songs) were common to the musical culture of Malaysia and Indonesia. Starting in the 1920s, local social dance and entertainment music such as asli, inang, joget, dondang sayang, zapin and masri were adapted by Bangsawan troupes to Anglo-American dance band arrangement but keeping the local folk character, and developed into modern Malay popular music. The Bangsawan troupes originated in the 19th century as a form of opera called Wayang Pasir that developed as an adaptation of Persian theatre brought to Malaya by performers from Bombay.  They portrayed stories from diverse groups such as Indian, Western, Islamic, Chinese, Indonesian and Malay with music, dance and acting in costumes. The musicians were mostly local Malays, Filipinos and Goans.

By providing protection and support, nailed horse shoes also improved the efficiency of draught horse teams.  Though the Romans had developed an iron hipposandal that resembled a hoof boot, there is much debate over the actual origins of the nailed horseshoe, though it does appear to be of European origin. There is little evidence of nailed-on shoes prior to AD 500 or 600, though there is speculation that the Celtic Gauls were the first to nail on metal horseshoes. The earliest clear written record of iron horseshoes is a reference to crescent figured irons and their nails in a list of cavalry equipment from AD 910. Additional archaeological evidence suggests they were used in Siberia during the 9th and 10th centuries, and had spread to Byzantium soon afterward; by the 11th century, horseshoes were commonly used in Europe.

There are two general types of proposals: tiltrotors with rotors that serve as both rotors and conventional propellers, and compound helicopters that use vertical rotors and separate rear-mounted propellers.  AVX and Sikorsky are offering compound designs with two counter-rotating rotors to provide vertical lift.  For forward movement, AVX uses two ducted fans and Sikorsky uses a single propeller on the back.  Bell is offering the V-280 Valor tiltrotor.  Karem Aircraft is offering a tiltrotor with optimum-speed rotors, allowing the aircraft to speed or slow the propellers depending on speed or efficiency demands.  Similar technology was used on the A160 Hummingbird.  JMR-TD is not to develop a prototype for the next family of vehicles or pre-select an airframe for FVL, but to develop and demonstrate an operationally representative mix of capabilities, technologies, and interfaces to investigate realistic design trades and enabling technologies.  The TIAs give the four teams nine months to complete preliminary design of their rotorcraft, which the Army will then review and authorize the construction of two competing demonstrators to fly in 2017.  While there was a potential for an early downselect, the four teams are focused on the 2017 flight demonstrations.  Emerging results from JMR TD Phase 1 will be used to inform the FVL effort regarding vehicle configurations, the maturity of enabling technologies, attainable performance and capabilities, and will highlight affordable technical solutions required to achieve those capabilities. Each of the four teams received $6.5 million from the Army for this phase of the program. On 21 October 2013, defense executives bidding for the program stated that the Army plans to downselect to two companies in 2014, who will then develop prototypes for flight tests in 2017.

Further technological, economic and social changes led to new forms of music in the 19th century, including the brass band, which produced a popular and communal form of classical music. Similarly, the music hall sprang up to cater for the entertainment of new urban societies, adapting existing forms of music to produce popular songs and acts.

Technology continued to influence music throughout the history of music, as it enabled new instruments and music notation reproduction systems to be used, with one of the watershed moments in music notation being the invention of the printing press in the 1400s, which meant music scores no longer had to be hand copied. In the 19th century, music technology led to the development of a more powerful, louder piano and led to the development of new valves brass instruments. In the early 20th century (in the late 1920s), as talking pictures emerged in the early 20th century, with their prerecorded musical tracks, an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work.

In 1709 Abraham Darby I, who had trained as an apprentice in Birmingham and worked in Bristol for the Birmingham ironmonger Sampson Lloyd, moved to Coalbrookdale in Shropshire and established the first blast furnace to successfully smelt iron with coke. In 1732 Lewis Paul and John Wyatt invented roller spinning  the one novel idea of the first importance in the development of the mechanised cotton industry  and in 1741 they opened the world's first cotton mill in Birmingham's Upper Priory. In 1765 Matthew Boulton opened the Soho Manufactory, pioneering the combination and mechanisation of previously separate manufacturing activities under one roof through a system known as rational manufacture. By the end of the decade this was the largest manufacturing unit in Europe with over 1,000 employees, and the foremost icon of the emerging factory system. John Roebuck's 1746 invention of the lead chamber process first enabled the large-scale manufacture of sulphuric acid, while James Keir pioneered the manufacture of alkali at his plant in Tipton; between them these two developments marked the birth of the modern chemical industry.The most notable technological innovation of the Midlands Enlightenment, however, was the 1775 development by James Watt and Matthew Boulton of the industrial steam engine, which incorporated four separate technical advances to allow it to cheaply and efficiently generate the rotary motion needed to power manufacturing machinery.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the  term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities.

This interpretation of Marx closely resembles that of Karl Kautsky and Georgi Plekhanov, and runs counter to most forms of twentieth century Marxism, which emphasized the importance of the relations of production. Cohen employs analytic philosophy to make his case. He defends technological determinism by arguing for two theses, which he calls the development thesis and the primacy thesis. The development thesis rests upon three presuppositions: that human beings are somewhat rational, that their historical situation is one of scarcity, and that they possess intelligence of a kind and degree which enables them to improve their situation. The existence of scarcity ensures a struggle for survival, the existence of intelligence ensures that scarcity-reducing innovations will occur, and the existence of rationality ensures that there will be a tendency to adopt them.

Whereas rock aspired to authenticity and an expansion of the possibilities of popular music, pop was more commercial, ephemeral and accessible. According to British musicologist Simon Frith, pop music is produced as a matter of enterprise not art, is designed to appeal to everyone and doesn't come from any particular place or mark off any particular taste. It is not driven by any significant ambition except profit and commercial reward ... and, in musical terms, it is essentially conservative.

The development of relatively inexpensive reproduction of music via a succession of formats including vinyl records, compact cassettes, compact discs (introduced in 1983) and, by the mid-1990s, digital audio recordings, and the transmission or broadcast of audio recordings of music performances on radio, of video recordings or live performances on television, and by the 1990s, of audio and video recordings via the Internet, using file sharing of digital audio recordings, gave individuals from a wide range of socioeconomic classes access to a diverse selection of high-quality music performances by artists from around the world. The introduction of multitrack recording in 1955 and the use of mixing had a major influence on pop and rock music, because it enabled record producers to mix and overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance. The development of sound recording and audio engineering technologies and the ability to edit these recordings gave rise to new subgenres of classical music, including the Musique concrte (1949) and acousmatic(1955) schools of electronic composition. In the 1970s, African-American hip hop musicians began to use the record turntable as a musical instrument, creating rhythmic and percussive scratching effects by manipulating a vinyl record on the turntable.",CAR_0c28ac790b48bd0e2ddaa331495894099808a12a,0," The middle of the 20th century saw a number of very important changes in American popular music.  The field of pop music developed tremendously during this period, as the increasingly low price of recorded music stimulated demand and greater profits for the record industry.  As a result, music marketing became more and more prominent, resulting in a number of mainstream pop stars whose popularity was previously unheard of.  Many of the first such stars were Italian-American crooners like Dean Martin, Rudy Vallee, Tony Bennett, Perry Como, Frankie Laine and, most famously, the first pop vocalist to engender hysteria among his fans Frank Sinatra. The era of the modern teen pop star, however, began in the 1960s. Bubblegum pop groups like The Monkees were chosen entirely for their appearance and ability to sell records, with no regard to musical ability.  The same period, however, also saw the rise of new forms of pop music that achieved a more permanent presence in the field of American popular music, including rock, soul and pop-folk. By the end of the 1960s, two developments had completely changed popular music: the birth of a counterculture, which explicitly opposed mainstream music, often in tandem with political and social activism, and the shift from professional composers to performers who were both singers and songwriters.",CAR_0c5d4aaaf35a86e8a14d4b31198b41bac4d010c6,4," The term was not generally used outside the confines of small music magazines until the mid 2000s, partly due to the exponential increase in bloggers who used it more seriously in analytical debate.

Sales of 'recordings' or sheet music are one measure.  Middleton and Manuel note that this definition has problems because multiple listens or plays of the same song or piece are not counted.  Evaluating appeal based on size of audience (mass appeal) or whether audience is of a certain social class is another way to define popular music, but this, too, has problems in that social categories of people cannot be applied accurately to musical styles. Manuel states that one criticism of popular music is that it is produced by large media conglomerates and passively consumed by the public, who merely buy or reject what music is being produced. He claims that the listeners in the scenario would not have been able to make the choice of their favorite music, which negates the previous conception of popular music.  Moreover, understandings of popular music have changed with time. Middleton argues that if research were to be done on the field of popular music, there would be a level of stability within societies to characterize historical periods, distribution of music, and the patterns of influence and continuity within the popular styles of music.",CAR_1cfdcdf9617a193d150920cdf551a02fcac6aa77,0," In 1976, when he was thirteen, Budjana's name started to be seen in the music world in Surabaya.

Despite that Amanda and Nikita are enemies, Amanda shows her way of affection to Alex. Although Alex can for the most part control herself from taking drugs or alcohol, she isn't allowed to take any type of drugs, such as pain pills, due to the fact that she might relapse. Therefore, if Alex gets shot, breaks an arm, or is seriously injured, she isn't allowed to take morphine that will help her with her pain. After Alex takes a bullet to the arm for Nikita, she isn't allowed to go on missions because she is still healing.

The two un-virtuous extremes are wastefulness and stinginess (or meanness). Stinginess is most obviously taking money too seriously, but wastefulness, less strictly speaking, is not always the opposite (an under estimation of the importance of money) because it is also often caused by being unrestrained. A wasteful person is destroyed by their own acts, and has many vices at once. Aristotle's approach to defining the correct balance is to treat money like any other useful thing, and say that the virtue is to know how to use money: giving to the right people, the right amount at the right time. Also, as with each of the ethical virtues, Aristotle emphasizes that such a person gets pleasures and pains at doing the virtuous and beautiful thing. Aristotle goes slightly out of his way to emphasize that generosity is not a virtue associated with making money, because, he points out, a virtuous person is normally someone who causes beautiful things, rather than just being a recipient. Aristotle also points out that we do not give much gratitude and praise at all to someone simply for not taking (which might however earn praise for being just). Aristotle also points out that generous people are loved practically the most of those who are recognized for virtue, since they confer benefits, and this consists in giving and he does not deny that generous people often won't be good at maintaining their wealth, and are often easy to cheat. Aristotle goes further in this direction by saying that it might seem that it is better to be wasteful than to be stingy: a wasteful person is cured by age, and by running out of resources, and if they are not merely unrestrained people then they are foolish rather than vicious and badly brought-up. Also, a wasteful person at least benefits someone. Aristotle points out also that a person with this virtue would not get money from someone he should not get it, in order to give for a decent sort of taking goes along with a decent sort of giving. Having said this however, most people we call wasteful are not only wasteful in the sense opposed to being generous, but also actually unrestrained and have many vices at once. Such people are actually often wasteful and stingy at the same time, and when trying to be generous they often take from sources whence they should not (for example pimps, loan sharks, gamblers, thieves), and they give to the wrong people. Such people can be helped by guidance, unlike stingy people, and most people are somewhat stingy. In fact, ends Aristotle, stinginess is reasonably called the opposite of generosity, both because it is a greater evil than wastefulness, and because people go wrong more often with it than from the sort of wastefulness described.",CAR_39385b0017edf85125006b3fd5a4a32a5b4f885f,0,,

Similarly, the music hall sprang up to cater for the entertainment of new urban societies, adapting existing forms of music to produce popular songs and acts.

They rediscovered rockabilly, Motown, ska, reggae and merged it with African rhythms to produce what was described as a fertile, stylistic cross-pollination. Author Simon Reynolds noted that the New Pop movement involved a conscious and brave attempt to bridge the separation between 'progressive' pop and masschart pop  a divide which has existed since 1967, and is also, broadly, one between boys and girls, middle-class and working-class.",CAR_038b5ab63ae3f5298719175a473a355aef2cfb03,3," In the 1980s, rap artists including Run DMC, Beastie Boys and LL Cool J set up the blueprints and origins of pop-rap as they suddenly broke into the mainstream. LL Cool J has been described as the very first pop-rapper in history, when he rose to prominence on his 1985 debut album Radio. When he joined Russell Simmons' Def Jam label and decided to try merging rap with pop and R&B influences, some people were skeptical that it would ever work. MTV has described LL Cool J's 1987 single I Need Love, as one of the first pop-rap crossover hits. Later, rap artists such as Tone Loc, Young MC, and Fresh Prince then made songs with lots of party tunes and storytelling abilities as they became very popular. During the 1990s, pop rap began to expand even more as hip hop music also began to connect strongly with dance music and R&B.

The corporate nature surrounding popular music streamlined it into a framework that focused on slight deviations from the accepted norm, creating what Adorno calls pseudo-individualism; what the public would perceive as unique or organic would musically comply with standard, established musical conventions. Thus, a duality emerged from this standardization, an industry-driven manipulation of the publics tastes to give people what they want while simultaneously guiding them to it. In the case of rock music, while the genre may have grown out of politicized forces and another form of meaningful motivation, the corporate influence over popular music became integral to its identity that directing public taste became increasingly easier. Technological developments allowed for easy dispersion of western music, causing the dominance of western music into rural and urbanized areas across the globe. However, because popular music assumes such a corporatized role and therefore remains subject to a large degree of standardization, ambiguity exists whether the music reflects actual cultural values or those only of the corporate sector seeking economic profit. Because popular music developed such a dependent relationship with media and the corporations surrounding it, where record sales and profit indirectly shaped musical decisions, the superstar person became an important element of popular music. From the fame and economic success surrounding such superstars, subcultures continued to arise, such as the rock and punk movements, only perpetuated by the corporate machine that also shaped the musical aspect of popular music.",CAR_7065b196e2f4c33c9aa288b543163e5b0364847c,0," Duck Soup is used as in-joke amongst characters portrayed as knowledgeable about the film in a Season 3 episode of The West Wing, while another episode in Season 6 recalls the general plot details of Duck Soup.  In Enemies Foreign and Domestic, C.J. Cregg, Sam Seaborn, and Toby Ziegler are discussing the relevancy of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in a post-Soviet world.  C.J., being briefed by Sam on a number of countries she has to mention as possible new candidates for NATO membership, wonders why Freedonia's being left out of the mix.  She goes on to reference Groucho Marx by singing Hooray for Captain Spaulding (which was his character in Animal Crackers) under her breath.  When upbraided by Toby for not taking the briefing seriously, she asks why her attempt at humor is less valid than Sam's or his.  Toby responds that he's heard her joke before, implying that he's seen Duck Soup.   Determined that her Marx Brothers references be respected, she ends the sequences of references by offering to pay Toby $500 if he'll sing Lydia the Tattooed Lady (a song sung by J.

During Season 6, Freedonia popped up again when Congressman Matt Santos, then hoping to become the Democratic nominee for president, showed his anger with modern political debates.

In the 2000s, poptimism (or popism) represented a critical reassessment of pop music, and in the 2010s, it supplanted rockism as the prevailing ideology in popular musical criticism.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 24, 2010. The episode serves primarily as a satire of pop culture criticism. Although the South Park boys wrote The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs simply to shock and offend people, readers delve too deeply into the meaning behind the book, finding hidden allegories and symbolism that the actual authors insist are not present. People with conflicting philosophies, including liberals and conservatives, and pro-choice and pro-life advocates, attempt to claim that the same work conveys and validates their own ideology. The script serves as a criticism of people who take such works of pop culture too seriously. Although this is demonstrated specifically through literary criticism in the episode, the theme can be extended to film criticism and television criticism as well. The episode suggests people are so desperate for inspiration, they are willing to impose their hopes and dreams into works of art, even if they completely lack those qualities. Some commentators thought South Park creators Parker and Matt Stone were implicitly mocking the amount of analysis into deeper meaning South Park itself often receives in its reviews. Others have suggested this over-analysis is a reference to the number of adult themes identified in the Harry Potter and Twilight young adult novel series.

The music charts contain songs from a variety of sources, including classical, jazz, rock, and novelty songs. Pop music, as a genre, is seen as existing and developing separately. Thus pop music may be used to describe a distinct genre, aimed at a youth market, often characterized as a softer alternative to rock and roll. Musicologist Allan Moore surmises that the term pop music itself may have originated from Pop art. Additionally, it's important to note that pop music is always evolving, which means that the definition of pop music can change, too. It's also important to be cognizant of the distinction between pop music and popular music. According to The New Grove Dictionary Of Music and Musicians, popular music is defined as the music since industrialization in the 1800's that is most in line with the tastes and interests of the urban middle class.",CAR_803600217bcf3beecf248e8d52020d5b2b4b9200,3,,

However, as early as 1970, Ronstadt was being criticized by music purists for her brand of music which crossed many genres. Country Western Stars magazine wrote in 1970 that Rock people thought she was too gentle, folk people thought she was too pop, and pop people didn't quite understand where she was at, but Country people really loved Linda.

Additionally, unlike Western music, the major second (sol and la) was usually not used in Japanese music, except art music, before rock music became popular in Japan. When the Group Sounds genre, which was inspired by Western rock, became popular,  Japanese pop music adopted the major second, which was used in the final sounds of The Beatles' song I Want to Hold Your Hand and The Rolling Stones' song (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.

The field of pop music developed tremendously during this period, as the increasingly low price of recorded music stimulated demand and greater profits for the record industry.  As a result, music marketing became more and more prominent, resulting in a number of mainstream pop stars whose popularity was previously unheard of.  Many of the first such stars were Italian-American crooners like Dean Martin, Rudy Vallee, Tony Bennett, Perry Como, Frankie Laine and, most famously, the first pop vocalist to engender hysteria among his fans Frank Sinatra. The era of the modern teen pop star, however, began in the 1960s. Bubblegum pop groups like The Monkees were chosen entirely for their appearance and ability to sell records, with no regard to musical ability.  The same period, however, also saw the rise of new forms of pop music that achieved a more permanent presence in the field of American popular music, including rock, soul and pop-folk. By the end of the 1960s, two developments had completely changed popular music: the birth of a counterculture, which explicitly opposed mainstream music, often in tandem with political and social activism, and the shift from professional composers to performers who were both singers and songwriters.",CAR_0c5d4aaaf35a86e8a14d4b31198b41bac4d010c6,4," Sjung received mostly positive reviews from music critics. The Swedish website, Kritiker, which assigns a normalised rating out of 5.0 to reviews from mainstream critics across the country gave the album an average score of 3.5, based on 25 reviews, which indicates favourable reviews. This score was just below that given to her debut album, and improved upon her previous two albums. Markus Larsson of Aftonbladet compared Laleh to Canadian singer Feist, saying that Feist's music sometimes feels like Laleh's big sister. He went on to say that the album is like a Spotify-list of Laleh favourites with multiple influences that haunts today's most modern pop music. He ends by calling this Laleh's second breakthrough. Anders Jaderup of Sydsvenskan praised the album for being less sprawling than her previous releases and stepping towards conventional mainstreampop without losing either the personality or the mixture of seriousness and fun as always influenced her music. He picked out Vrens frsta dag (Spring's First Day) as showing exuberant energy and being a great pop song. In a review for local newspaper Norran, Per Strmbro praised Laleh's producing and said that the record was often quite grand, with big words and concepts. Nanushka Yeaman from Dagens Nyheter praised the personal feel to the album which is nice and touching. They went on to say that this is Laleh's strongest album to date and there is no doubt that she will take festival-Sweden this summer. Anders Nunstedt, music editor from the Swedish tabloid Expressen, said the album may well be the year's big Swedish pop record. He noted that the step from African rhythms on Elephant to the Abba-drama that bloom in the chorus of Some Die Young is great, and that the gentle soul which appears in Who Started It is at another musical discipline than the feverish indie pop that stains the Vrens Frsta Dag, but Laleh's songs connect... in spite of all genres and language changes.",CAR_8e6c80403ddd839f0fc72554b566126a38945153,0," SIM's new technology was meant to lead to the development of telescopes powerful enough to take images of Earth-like extrasolar planets orbiting distant stars and to determine whether those planets are able to sustain life.

It emerged in the mid-to late 1950s as a softer alternative to rock 'n' roll and later to rock music. Like American pop music it has a focus on commercial recording, often orientated towards a youth market, as well as that of the Singles Chart usually through the medium of relatively short and simple love songs. While these basic elements of the genre have remained fairly constant, pop music has absorbed influences from most other forms of popular music, particularly borrowing from the development of rock music, and utilising key technological innovations to produce new variations on existing themes. From the British Invasion of the 1960s, led by The Beatles, British pop music has alternated between acts and genres with national appeal and those with international success that have had a considerable impact on the development of the wider genre and on popular music in general.",CAR_90004c3c9d3f41aeb0d08668f491e7a08e1298fc,3,,

In a 2009 review, BBC praised the album, and described the album as a rock record that kept the dance spirit alive, but could also appeal to a pop audience: Lost Souls was a record that was widely discussed, and people wondered aloud whether its success marked the end of another era of dance music. In truth, it was a record about growing up; about giving up the drugs and the madness of The Haienda, where the three Cheshire lads met. But because the simmering emotion on songs like The Cedar Room was expressed through guitars rather than synths, in no way did that mean that Doves were taking dance music out the back and burying it in a shallow grave. But there was emotion, too  The Cedar Room is a beautiful seven-minute break-up song that complains: I tried to sleep alone, but I couldn't do it. This was a pop album that eventually appealed widely, and not just to the grown-up clubbers that could have been its sole audience. Q called the album heavy, sombre and lugubrious... it makes for seriously claustrophobic listening, until it takes a great gulp of euphoria. NME awarded the album 9 out of 10 stars, and called the album a serious and intense record... the first great album to come from Manchester since Definitely Maybe... they make being sad after drugs sound great. In a mixed review, Pitchfork Media reviewer Sam Eccleston took a straightforward and cynical approach with the album and rated it 6.8 out of 10, saying, Tonally, Lost Souls reflects the after-after-midnight hours, as if the boys felt the need to document the hung-over and blissed-out aftermath of the dancing-hours frenzy their Sub Sub days offered listeners years ago. The review goes on to say that, The heart of the problem on Lost Souls is its overreaching ambition ...but... despite its reach and ambition, works best in its most conventionally melodic moments.",CAR_9a8875ccbc044f75e493658a6ea56d612efab726,2," The most common early mix tapes were bootleg 8 track tapes that were sold at flea markets and truck stops in the late 1960s through the early 1980s, with names like Super 73, Country Chart Toppers or Top Pops 1977. Homemade mix tapes became common in the 1980s.  Although the compact audio cassette by Philips appeared at the 1963 Berlin Radio Show, the sound quality of cassettes was not good enough to be seriously considered for music recording until further advances in tape formulations, including the advent of chrome and metal tape. Before the introduction of the audio cassette, the creation of a pop music compilation required specialized or cumbersome equipment, such as a reel-to-reel or 8 track recorder, that was often inaccessible to the casual music fan. As cassette tapes and recorders grew in popularity and portability, these technological hurdles were lowered to the point where the only resources required to create a mix were a handful of cassettes and a cassette recorder connected to a source of pre-recorded music, such as a radio or LP player. The 8-track tape cartridge was more popular for music recording during much of the 1960s, as the cassette was originally only mono and intended for vocal recordings only, such as in office dictation machines.  But improvements in fidelity finally allowed the cassette to become a major player.  The ready availability of the cassette and higher quality home recording decks to serve the casual home user allowed the cassette to become the dominant tape format, to the point that the 8 track tape nearly disappeared shortly after the turn of the 1980s.  The growth of the mixtape was also encouraged by improved quality and increased popularity of audio cassette players in car entertainment systems, and by the introduction of the Sony Walkman in 1979.",CAR_9b76d2790cf760f8b4fb7b49a762e3d84b4b1819,0," Popular music in the 1990s  saw the continuation of teen pop and dance-pop trends which had emerged in the 1970s and 1980s.

Aside from rap, reggae, contemporary R&B and urban music in general remained extremely popular throughout the decade; urban music in the late-1980s and 1990s often blended with styles such as soul, funk and jazz, resulting in fusion genres such as new jack swing, neo-soul, hip hop soul and g-funk which were popular.",CAR_9df4c8247ef47eefd4e985321cdd2ca8d955a437,1," According to the website of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, called Grove Music Online, the term pop music originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced. The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that while pop's earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience ... since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical music, usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, ABBA, etc. Grove Music Online also states that ... in the early 1960s the term 'pop music' competed terminologically with beat music in England, while in the USA its coverage overlapped (as it still does) with that of 'rock and roll'.",CAR_a131519e264d4517b719d55fc4a75c67a8eaacda,2," From about 1967, the term was increasingly used in opposition to the term rock music, a division that gave generic significance to both terms. Whereas rock aspired to authenticity and an expansion of the possibilities of popular music, pop was more commercial, ephemeral and accessible. According to British musicologist Simon Frith, pop music is produced as a matter of enterprise not art, is designed to appeal to everyone and doesn't come from any particular place or mark off any particular taste. It is not driven by any significant ambition except profit and commercial reward ... and, in musical terms, it is essentially conservative. It is, provided from on high (by record companies, radio programmers and concert promoters) rather than being made from below ... Pop is not a do-it-yourself music but is professionally produced and packaged. ",CAR_0897bc97bf4bfbd17776e7e88fbeafdb7ccfda22,3,,

At the beginning of the 1960s, pop and rock and roll trends of the 1950s continued; nevertheless, the rock and roll of the decade before started to merge into a more international, eclectic variant known as rock. In the early-1960s, rock and roll in its purest form was gradually overtaken by pop rock, beat, psychedelic rock, blues rock, and folk rock, which had grown in popularity. The country- and folk-influenced style associated with the latter-half of 1960s rock music spawned a generation of popular singer-songwriters who wrote and performed their own work. Towards the decade's end, genres such as Baroque pop, sunshine pop, bubblegum pop, and progressive rock started to grow popular, with the latter two finding greater success in the following decade. Furthermore, the 1960s saw funk and soul music rising in popularity; rhythm and blues in general remained popular, and this style was commonly associated to Girl groups of the time, whose fusion of R&B and Gospel with rock and roll enjoyed success until the mid-part of the decade.

The company first started selling its pop in the mid-1960s in its own retail outlets in Detroit, known as pop centers.  It was an affordable alternative to bigger brands such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi, and often sold well in Detroit's poorer neighborhoods. The pop centers offered many more flavors of soda pop than were typically seen in grocery stores, and the pop was sold by the 24-glass-bottle wooden case. People would enter the store, grab a wooden crate, and walk around the various stacks of pop around the warehouse-type store. Customers would bring back empty bottles and cases and start all over again. ",CAR_cc6be70aa497c361242dd8dc266ed4e57a554f90,0," The second season of the series positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating with an average rating of 8.210 based on 5 reviews. Jim Kaz of IGN gave the season a similar score at 810. While at first hesitant of the series, believing it to be another horrorsci-fioccult hybrid currently igniting ratings, he found the eerie and intricate storylines to overcome the initial impressions of Clearasil ads and Paris Hilton in House of Wax. Praising the cliffhangers and the brotherly chemistry between the lead actors, Kaz deemed Supernatural one-helluva edge-of-your-seat, ball-burner of a series with a forceful script, excellent acting (said pretty boys included) and some fine special effects. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune thoroughly enjoyed the season, and really, really liked the Roadhouse. Not understanding why the Roadhouse was not used more throughout the season, she was pretty annoyed when it was destroyed. Ryan also favored the new hunter characters, especially Ash, and was not thrilled when Ash was killed. Regarding Sam and Dean, she noted the series' ability  the brotherly conflicts and emotions threaded through a well-plotted monster-of-the-week story. While she enjoyed Tricia Helfer's guest appearance, she did not enjoy the stunt casting of Linda Blair and would have preferred a more skilled actress. The season received a grade of a B- from Brian Tallerico of UGO, who found it frustrating due to the use of the same predictable formula that did not meet the standards of the first season. Other problems he found included the brothers turning whiny and mopey and taking everything too seriously. However, he believed that the season ended stronghe liked how the main storyline was wrapped up, opening new storylinesand noted that there were some excellent episodes. Tallerico praised the tongue-in-cheek Winchester adventure The Usual Suspects, feeling that it had enough pop culture references to make Tarantino jealous and the pitch-perfect mix of tones that make the show so great. He also found Nightshifter to be the best action hour of Supernaturals second year, deeming it riveting from beginning to end. Also applauding the season's cliffhanger was Peter Brown of iFMagazine, who gave the season a B+. He enjoyed the expansion of the series' mythology, as well as the new characters introduced.

If we take into account the pop sensations that Madalena Iglesias and Simone de Oliveira were, contemporary Portuguese music should have started around the same time. And it should have happened in a rather jovial way as the young pop environment was breaking ground in society through the youngsters. Electronic music, which was rising in Germany, was then exported to Portugal, revealing itself as a success in the '80s.The pop fever got stronger in the '70s, also known as the roaring years along with the '20s, with the growth of equally fulminating nightclubs largely situated on the coastline. It should be mentioned that the settling of this music genre had a very unneven growth between the coastline and the midland, the north and mid-north, and the south and mid-south. Whilst coastal and cosmopolitan Lisbon was following trends, even if discretely when compared to other European capitals, the midland was still completely clueless, remaining behind its time even today.The Hippie era strikes the country with its relaxed and urban style, and Portugal adapts itself deeply to this new trend. The Disco fever emerges and with it, the nightclubs. While in a corruptible dictatorship regime, responsible for years of cultural delay in comparison to the rest of Europe, the voice of artists like that of Antnio Variaes and Carlos Paios, among others, started to become popular. Both had an enormous success. Songs like Playback and P de Arroz (Rice powder) from Paio, and O Corpo  que paga (The Body pays it) from Variaes, are unforgettable. The death of Antnio Variaes, in 1984 was a great loss for contemporary music.However, ten years earlier, in 1974, when Portugal was still testing the waters of this new cool disco look, peaceful revolution took place on 25 April, which  defined the Portuguese way of being. The most interesting part is that the Carnation Revolution (Revoluo dos Cravos), as it would later be called, started with a song: Grndola, Vila Morena, an intervention song which derived from intervention poetry. The intervention song got popular and its grieving content was a success, notwithstanding its hopeful and dreamy side, in the history of European contemporary music. Fado is put on the backburner, as it was considered to bring back memories from Salazars dictatorship, and brought back up only in mid-90s.In the 80s, electronic music became popular and was broadcast on radio and played in nightclubs in Lisbon. The rural midland finally starts to take its first steps on catching on to its contemporaries. Electronic music begins to conquer listeners from remote areas. Portugal also joins a rather eccentric and unusual age. Its the beginning of the age of rock music. Punk and dark rock derived from it shortly after, among others, and later on, metal and heavy metal did too. These are still conquering new listeners nowadays.By the 90s Xutos e Pontaps had started performing, and Rui Veloso  became the best Portuguese Rock artist to date.

Before the reforms implemented by the government, the entertainment industry was completely limited due to the tight censorship and the widespread poverty, which prevented the music scene from flourishing. From the 1970s to the late 1980s, the strictly patriotic songs, sponsored by the communist government, and the traditional Mor Lam genere were the only generes available to listen. At the start of the 1990s decade, the Lao music scene started transformating. The first private music labels started emerging in Vientiane, the capital city, and some live music pubs appeared. However, these labels, at first, were financially weak and had a very limited capacity to promote their artists. Although at first the traditional Lao music, was still the most popular genere, the foreign influence of Korean K-Pop music, Japanese J-Pop music, and the pop music made in the neighbouring Thailand started being felt, not only in the fashion trends, but also in the local musical scene.From the start of the 2000s, L-pop saw a dramatic increase of popularity due to the growing strength of the mainly Vientiane based music labels such as Lao-Pride Records, KPY Entertainment, Indee Records and Muanson Media. Lao pop gained local and international spotlight through Alexandra Bounxouei, who is considered to be the first Lao pop princess.

The literacy rate in 2001 has been recorded at 64.84% as against 52.21% in 1991. The 12.63 percentage points increase in the literacy rate during the period is the highest increase in any decade. Also for the first time there is a decline in the absolute number of non-literates during the past 10 years. The total number of non literates has come down from 328 million in 1991 to 304 million in 2001. During 1991-2000, the population in 7+ age group increased by 176 millions while 201 million additional persons became literate during that period. Out of 864 million people above the age of 7 years, 560 million are now literates. Three-fourths of our male population and more than half of the female population are literate. This indeed is an encouraging indicator for us to speed up our march towards the goal of achieving a sustainable threshold literacy rate of 75% by 2007.  The Census 2001 provisional figures also indicate that the efforts of the nation during the past decade to remove the scourge of illiteracy have not gone in vain. The eradication of illiteracy from a vast country like India beset by several social and economic hurdles is not an easy task. Realising this the National Literacy Mission was set up on 5 May 1988 to impart a new sense of urgency and seriousness to adult education. After the success of the areas specific, time bound, voluntary based campaign approach first in Kottayam city and then in Ernakulum district in Kerala in 1990, the National Literacy Mission had accepted the literacy campaigns as the dominant strategy for eradication of illiteracy. Out of 600 districts in the country,597 districts have already been covered under Total Literacy Campaigns. The number of continuing education districts is 328. The creditable performance of the National Literacy Mission received international recognition when it was awarded the UNESCO Noma Literacy Prize for 1999. The International Jury while selecting NLM for the prize recognised its initiation of the Total Literacy Campaigns and also its efforts in galvanising activities towards integration, conservation of the environment, promotion of women's equality, and the preservation of family customs and traditions. The Jury also appreciated the training imparted by NLM, the teaching learning material produced by it and the awareness created by it for the demand for raising both the quality and quantity of primary education. The Bureau of Adult Education and National Literacy Mission under the Department of School Education and Literacy of the Ministry of Human Resource Development functions as the Secretariat of the National Literacy Mission Authority. The General Council of the NLMA is headed by the Minister of Human Resource Development and the Executive Council is headed by the Secretary (Elementary Education and Literacy). The Directorate of Adult Education provides necessary technical and resource support to the NLMA. The National Literacy Mission was revitalised with the approval of the Union Government on 30 September 1999. The Mission's goal is to attain total literacy i.e. a sustainable threshold literacy rate of 75% by 2007. The Mission seeks to achieve this by imparting functional literacy to non-literates in the 15-35 age group. To tackle the problem of residual illiteracy, now it has been decided to adopt an integrated approach to Total Literacy Campaigns and Post Literacy Programme. This means the basic literacy campaigns and post literacy programmes will be implemented under one literacy project called 'Literacy Campaigns an Operation Restoration' to achieve continuity, efficiency and convergence and to minimise unnecessary time lag between the two. Post literacy programmes are treated only as a preparatory phase for launching Continuing Education with the ultimate aim of creating a learning society. In order to promote decentralization, the State Literacy Mission Authorities have been given the authority to sanction continuing education projects to Districts and literacy related projects to voluntary agencies in their States. The scheme of Jan Shikshan Sansthan or Institute of People's Education, previously known as the Scheme of Shramik Vidyapeeth was initially evolved as a non-formal continuing education programme to respond to the educational and vocational training needs of adults and young people living in urban and industrial areas and for persons who had migrated from rural to urban settings. Now the Institutes' activities have been enlarged and infrastructure strengthened to enable them to function as district level repositories of vocational and technical skills in both urban and rural areas.

The field of pop music developed tremendously during this period, as the increasingly low price of recorded music stimulated demand and greater profits for the record industry.  As a result, music marketing became more and more prominent, resulting in a number of mainstream pop stars whose popularity was previously unheard of.  Many of the first such stars were Italian-American crooners like Dean Martin, Rudy Vallee, Tony Bennett, Perry Como, Frankie Laine and, most famously, the first pop vocalist to engender hysteria among his fans Frank Sinatra. The era of the modern teen pop star, however, began in the 1960s. Bubblegum pop groups like The Monkees were chosen entirely for their appearance and ability to sell records, with no regard to musical ability.  The same period, however, also saw the rise of new forms of pop music that achieved a more permanent presence in the field of American popular music, including rock, soul and pop-folk.

The term may also reference a putative journey undertaken by traditional African music from its homeland to the United States and back. Some scholars and ethnomusicologists have speculated that the origins of the blues can be traced to the musical traditions of Africa, as retained by African-Americans during and after slavery. Even though the blues is a key component of American popular music, its rural, African-American origins are largely undocumented, and its stylistic links with African instrumental traditions are somewhat tenuous.  One musical influence that can be traced back to African sources is that of the plantation work songs with their call-and-response format, and more especially the relatively free-form field hollers of the later sharecroppers, which seem to have been directly responsible for the characteristic vocal style of the blues.

The report boosted the need for phone manufacturers like Nokia and Motorola to join the bandwagon and explore several music options including the development of a music store strategy by Nokia and the integration of iTunes into a phone by Motorola with its Rocker.  Sony, Samsung, and LG were too busy focusing on increasing pixelation and stability within CDDMA camera modules. Sony tried to leverage the Cybershot technology in a multimedia strategy, but it was too slow of a change. While Samsung was driving the high tier segment improving display capability.  Nokia worked hard to drive DRM technology to be included into its OVI music store and introduced a new music phone line called Xpress music banking on end user needs rather than on operators wants because the line was expected to receive lower subsidies from operators than others.  In this way, Nokia was banking on the Idea of the report that music could be used to drive customer acquisition at that time rather than data revenues for the time, as mentioned in the report from Strategy Analytics.    The Rocker was a success driving new adherents into a highly competitive US market even though it still remained tied to a computer for music downloads. It could be said that it was the adoption of the Rocker by ATT as an acquisition strategy for the US market that prompted operators to purchase music capable phones and manufacturers to develop them.  This success of ATT to drive acquisitions was copied by other operators such as Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile, which also drove the introduction of music into the cellphones.

Sales of 'recordings' or sheet music are one measure.  Middleton and Manuel note that this definition has problems because multiple listens or plays of the same song or piece are not counted.  Evaluating appeal based on size of audience (mass appeal) or whether audience is of a certain social class is another way to define popular music, but this, too, has problems in that social categories of people cannot be applied accurately to musical styles. Manuel states that one criticism of popular music is that it is produced by large media conglomerates and passively consumed by the public, who merely buy or reject what music is being produced. He claims that the listeners in the scenario would not have been able to make the choice of their favorite music, which negates the previous conception of popular music.

Since music has traditionally been viewed as a subject outside of academia, and music has been incorporated into schools as a secondary subject, or often as an elective, there is limited research on classroom benefits of music as a core subject. Many researchers have explored both the benefits to listening to music passively as well as pursuing music actively, as with learning an instrument. The benefits music in the classroom and its effects on brain development, academic performance, and practical life skills have been observed through research by Jenny Nam Yoon. She concluded that the two hemispheres of the brain are stimulated when music is played and how the corpus callosum, the bridge that connects the two hemispheres is larger in musician's brains. The effects of strictly listening to music have long been explored and has been given the name the Mozart Effect, which is known to cause a small increase in spatial-temporal reasoning. As seen with the Mozart Effect, listening to music has been proven to affect the brain and mood, as well as spatial temporal reasoning, but does not have any long-term benefits. A 1981 study at Mission Vejo High School proved that music students had a higher GPA than students who did not participate in music (3.59 vs. 2.91).

According to the history explained in Norwegian on the Grieg Academy-UiBs official website, towards the end of the 1980s, the conservatory faced major restructuring, and a government report recommended closer cooperation with the University of Bergen. In the autumn of 1995, Nina Grieg's 150th birthday and 90 years after Torgrim Castberg first opened the Music Academy, the Conservatoire was founded as an institute at the University of Bergen, and Grieg Academy was established as a ceiling (or umbrella ...) of all music education programs under both the University of Bergen and Bergen University College. Also, according to a 1996 report from the website of University of Bergen, The Grieg Academy is a partnership between the University and Bergen University College who has since earlier been offering a major in music education. This academic partnership rests on three pillars: music pedagogy at the former teachers college and appliedcreative music and musicology at the University. Due to both marketing strategies and inter-institutional politics, the Grieg Academy-UiB has in recent years increasingly taken a public stance implying that it is the Grieg Academy, yet for those who know this history it remains undeniably clear that the Grieg Academy actually continues to be spread across two institutions, University of Bergen and Bergen University College, with some forms of collaboration. In recent years, the folk music school Ole Bull Academy in nearby Voss (named after renowned violin virtuoso Ole Bull), has also been to some extent brought under the Grieg Academy umbrella.

Music critic Simon Reynolds cited Are You That Somebody? as the most radical pop single of 1998. Kelefah Sanneh of The New York Times wrote that rather than being the song's focal point, Aaliyah knew how to disappear into the music, how to match her voice to the bass line, and consequently helped change the way popular music sounds; the twitchy, beat-driven songs of Destiny's Child owe a clear debt to 'Are You That Somebody'. Sanneh asserted that by the time of her death in 2001, Aaliyah had recorded some of the most innovative and influential pop songs of the last five years. Music publication pop dust called Aaliyah an unlikely queen of the underground mainly due to her influence on the underground alternative music scene which consist of heavy sampling of her music and many references that are made to her discography by underground artist, pop dust also mentioned that Aaliyah's forward thinking music that she did with timbaland and the experimental music being made by many underground alternative artist are some what cut from the same cloth. While compiling a list of artist that take cues from Aaliyah MTV Hive mentioned that its easy to spot her influence on underground movements like dubstep, strains of indie pop, and in the lo-fi R&B movements.

According to Hassett and Curwood, authors of Theories and Practices of Multimodal Education, Print represents only one mode of communication and with a rise in digital and Internet literacy, other modes are needed, from visual texts to digital e-books. Other changes occur by integrating music and video with lesson plans during early childhood education; however, such measures are seen as augmenting and increasing literacy for educational communities by introducing new forms, rather than replacing literacy values. In several childrens books released today, written language is no longer the most important factor while producing these books. According to Miller and McVee, authors of Multimodal Composing in Classrooms, These new literacies do not set aside traditional literacies. Students still need to know how to read and write, but new literacies are integrated. The main purpose of early childhood education is still evident but the form that is now being presented to children is different. Some learning outcomes include  but are not limited to  reading, writing, and language skills. For example, Multimodal Composing In Classrooms, written by Miller and McVee, advocates storyboarding as an assignment and says that it is multimodal in that there is the visual and audio of a film clip, the drawing representation of the films images, as well as the written analysis of the scene. According to Roger Essley in his article, Visual Tools for Differentiating Reading & Writing Instruction, storyboarding is the origin of all written language.

His position also gave him the ability to shape the forces that would play his music, as he could select skilled musicians. This opportunity was not wasted, as Haydn, beginning quite early on his career, sought to press forward the technique of building and developing ideas in his music. His next important breakthrough was in the Opus 33 string quartets (1781), in which the melodic and the harmonic roles segue among the instruments: it is often momentarily unclear what is melody and what is harmony. This changes the way the ensemble works its way between dramatic moments of transition and climactic sections: the music flows smoothly and without obvious interruption. He then took this integrated style and began applying it to orchestral and vocal music.File:Don Giovanni Commendatore.pngthumbleft400pxThe opening bars of the Commedatore's aria in Mozart's opera Don Giovanni. The orchestra starts with a dissonant diminished seventh chord (g# dim7 with a B in the bass) moving to a dominant seventh chord (A7 with a C# in the bass) before resolving to the tonic chord (d minor) at the singer's entrance.Haydn's gift to music was a way of composing, a way of structuring works, which was at the same time in accord with the governing aesthetic of the new style. However, a younger contemporary, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, brought his genius to Haydn's ideas and applied them to two of the major genres of the day: opera, and the virtuoso concerto. Whereas Haydn spent much of his working life as a court composer, Mozart wanted public success in the concert life of cities, playing for the general public. This meant he needed to write operas and write and perform virtuoso pieces. Haydn was not a virtuoso at the international touring level; nor was he seeking to create operatic works that could play for many nights in front of a large audience. Mozart wanted to achieve both. Moreover, Mozart also had a taste for more chromatic chords (and greater contrasts in harmonic language generally), a greater love for creating a welter of melodies in a single work, and a more Italianate sensibility in music as a whole. He found, in Haydn's music and later in his study of the polyphony of J.S. Bach, the means to discipline and enrich his artistic gifts.",CAR_644c173d67fc7393799c0d839ae7267138d54d8d,0,,

The corporate nature surrounding popular music streamlined it into a framework that focused on slight deviations from the accepted norm, creating what Adorno calls pseudo-individualism; what the public would perceive as unique or organic would musically comply with standard, established musical conventions. Thus, a duality emerged from this standardization, an industry-driven manipulation of the publics tastes to give people what they want while simultaneously guiding them to it. In the case of rock music, while the genre may have grown out of politicized forces and another form of meaningful motivation, the corporate influence over popular music became integral to its identity that directing public taste became increasingly easier. Technological developments allowed for easy dispersion of western music, causing the dominance of western music into rural and urbanized areas across the globe. However, because popular music assumes such a corporatized role and therefore remains subject to a large degree of standardization, ambiguity exists whether the music reflects actual cultural values or those only of the corporate sector seeking economic profit. Because popular music developed such a dependent relationship with media and the corporations surrounding it, where record sales and profit indirectly shaped musical decisions, the superstar person became an important element of popular music. From the fame and economic success surrounding such superstars, subcultures continued to arise, such as the rock and punk movements, only perpetuated by the corporate machine that also shaped the musical aspect of popular music.",CAR_7065b196e2f4c33c9aa288b543163e5b0364847c,0," In the fall of 2013, SoNA launched an arts integration educational program, ImagiMusic, which has enabled SoNA to reach over 3,000 students from ten regional Tier 1 schools.",CAR_155a70cada8a54ecfd84479d20a2749679029a85,1," He has been interviewed on music and pop culture topics on ABC's 2020, CBS Evening News, CNNfn, VH1's Behind the Music, MTV, BBC, A&E's Biography and E!; and has been quoted in the New York Times, USA Today, TV Guide, People, Parade, Us and Entertainment Weekly.

Mitch Miller, A&R man at the era's most successful label, Columbia Records, set the tone for the development of popular music well into the middle of the decade.  Miller integrated country, Western, rhythm & blues, and folk music into the musical mainstream, by having many of his label's biggest artists record them in a style that corresponded to Pop traditions.  Miller often employed novel and ear-catching arrangements featuring classical instruments (whooping french horns, harpsichord), or sound effects (whip cracks).

Educators and theorists such as Odo of Cluny and Guido d'Arezzo in the  10th and 11th centuries explored methods to teach these new developing notational practices. Academic interest in music education lessened by the Renaissance as universities abandoned music as a part of their curriculum in the mid 16th century, while the Protestant Reformation later brought some changes to music education, Martin Luther among other individuals suggesting that music, poetry, and history be added to standard education curriculum. In the 17th century, John Amos Comenius recommended music education for religious purposes and designed a methodology to do so, as Richard Mulcaster encouraged universal education including singing and playing as standard curriculum.

The music charts contain songs from a variety of sources, including classical, jazz, rock, and novelty songs. Pop music, as a genre, is seen as existing and developing separately. Thus pop music may be used to describe a distinct genre, aimed at a youth market, often characterized as a softer alternative to rock and roll. Musicologist Allan Moore surmises that the term pop music itself may have originated from Pop art. Additionally, it's important to note that pop music is always evolving, which means that the definition of pop music can change, too. It's also important to be cognizant of the distinction between pop music and popular music.

From their EP Hot Issue (2007), the shibuya-kei-influenced Fool (Korean: ; Revised Romanization: Babo) contained a heavy dance beat paired with a smooth disco coating, with G-Dragon's falsetto in the song garnering praise as a pleasant surprise. Day by Day from Stand Up (2008) was admired for weaving in and out of tempos seamlessly and forcing a sense of anxiety on the listener through the beating undercurrent and hailed as an experiential masterpiece. They also collaborated with the Korean rock-band No Brain for Oh My Friend, a rock-based song.  Alive (2012) was noted for being more experimental than their previous materials, with Blue being distinguished for including more interesting electronic samples and production techniques and Bad Boy described as having a nostalgic sentiment, being called a perfect pop song, that transcends language.  The album was also praised for showcasing the group's voice instead of their usual autotune, being described as having a mature kind of intensity. Their song Monster was praised for its use of the piano and orchestra sound and the composition for Bingle Bingle (Korean: ; Revised Romanization: Binggeul Binggeul) was noted for being electronic and retro, similar to the work of Katy Perry and Daft Punk.  The group mixed a variety electronic music with soft rock for their Made (2015) series.

Whereas salsa occasionally superimposes elements of another genre, or incorporates a non-salsa style in the bridge of a song, Cuban popular music since the 1970s has fully integrated North American jazz and funk to the point of true hybrid.

Although this was not the first exposure to foreign music for China, as there had been a growing awareness of  the unique brand of western influenced popular music in Hong Kong, known as  Cantopop, the cachet of being American undoubtedly aided the idea of popular music in the USA to enter the Chinese market and influence the change of cultural and social values (Rupke & Blank, 2009).

A fMRI study revealed that the Broca's and Wernicke's areas, two areas that are known to activated during speech and language processing, were found activated while the subject was listening to unexpected musical chords (Elzbieta, 2015). This relation between language and music may explain why, it has been found that exposure to music has produced an acceleration in the development of behaviors related to the acquisition of language. The Suzuki music education which is very widely known, emphasizes learning music by ear over reading musical notation and preferably begins with formal lessons between the ages of 3 and 5 years. One fundamental reasoning in favor of this education points to a parallelism between natural speech acquisition and purely auditory based musical training as opposed to musical training due to visual cues. There is evidence that children who take music classes have obtained skills to help them in language acquisition and learning (Oechslin, 2015), an ability that relies heavily on the dorsal pathway. Other studies show an overall enhancement of verbal intelligence in children taking music classes.

One notable singer to do so is Keisuke Kuwata, who pronounced the Japanese word karada (body) as kyerada.  Additionally, unlike Western music, the major second (sol and la) was usually not used in Japanese music, except art music, before rock music became popular in Japan. When the Group Sounds genre, which was inspired by Western rock, became popular,  Japanese pop music adopted the major second, which was used in the final sounds of The Beatles' song I Want to Hold Your Hand and The Rolling Stones' song (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.

Like American pop music it has a focus on commercial recording, often orientated towards a youth market, as well as that of the Singles Chart usually through the medium of relatively short and simple love songs. While these basic elements of the genre have remained fairly constant, pop music has absorbed influences from most other forms of popular music, particularly borrowing from the development of rock music, and utilising key technological innovations to produce new variations on existing themes.

Based mostly (but not exclusively) in urban centers, Indonesia's recording studios have increasingly diversified out of the template established by the country's two largest recording companies, P.N. Lokananta (the national recording company of Indonesia) and Hidup Baru. In contrast to the 1950s and 1960s, many studios today are no longer owned solely by producers. Increasingly, artists themselves decide to build home-based studios furnished with up-to-date digital equipment, usually imported from Singapore. In particular, the rise of underground music (also called alternative music, or musik alternatif) has given individuals armed with music production skills and the appropriate tools a forum through which their recordings may be disseminated. The preferred method of producing and distributing Indonesian underground music is defiantly localist, operating outside the channels of the commercial music industry. For example, underground cassettes are, as a rule, not found in mall stores, cassette stalls, or any other conventional retail outlet. It is, in fact, illegal to sell them, as the Indonesian government does not collect any tax on the transaction. As a result, music producers and the musicians they work with have since 2000 begun to open underground boutiques (toko underground) in Jakarta, Bandung, Surabaya, Denpasar and other locales. These establishments are often owned and operated by veteran underground scene members and sometimes include rehearsal and recording studios as well. Through an integration of the production and retail functions of popular music making, technology innovations in Indonesia increasingly occur in localized, underground settings, as they often have in other parts of the world. At the same time, new technologies have not overpowered popular music recording in Indonesia nor Westernized the musical life of the country.

This comes into play with the integration of media and society. Some of the largest challenges we face in regards to the participation gap is in education, learning, accessibility, and privacy. All of these factors are huge setbacks when it comes to the relatively new integration of youth participating in todays popular forms of media.Education is one realm where the participatory gap is very prominent. In todays society, our education system heavily focuses on integrating media into its curriculum. More and more our classrooms are utilizing computers and technology as learning aides. While this is beneficial for students and teachers to enhance learning environments and allow them to access a plethora of information, it also presents many problems. The participation gap leaves many schools as well as its teachers and students at a disadvantage as they struggle to utilize current technology in their curriculum. Many schools do not have to funding to invest in computers or new technologies for their academic programs. They are unable to afford computers, camera, and interactive learning tools, which prevents students from accessing the tools that other, wealthier schools have.Another challenge is that as we integrate new technology into schools and academics, we need to be able to teach people how to use these instruments. Teaching both student and adults how to use new media technologies is essential so that they can actively participate as their peers do. Additionally, teaching children how to navigate the information available on new media technologies is very important as there is so much content available on the internet these days. For beginners this can be overwhelming and teaching kids as well as adults how to access what is pertinent, reliable and viable information will help them improve how they utilize media technologies.One huge aspect of the participation gap is access. Access to the Internet and computers is a luxury in some households, and in the todays society, access to a computer and the Internet is often overlooked by both the education system and many other entities. In todays society, almost everything we do is based online, from banking to shopping to homework and ordering food, we spend all of our time doing everyday tasks online. For those who are unable to access these things, they are automatically put at a severe disadvantage. They cannot participate in activities that their peers do and may suffer both academically and socially.The last feature of the participation gap is privacy concerns. We put everything on the Internet these days, from pictures to personal information. It is important to question how this content will be used. Who owns this content? Where does it go or where is it stored? For example, the controversy of Facebook and its ownership and rights of users content has been a hot button issue over the past few years. It is disconcerting to a lot of people to find out that their content they have posted to a particular website is no longer under their control, but may be retained and used by the website in the future.All of the above-mentioned issued are key factors in the participation gap. They play a large role is the challenges we face as we incorporate new media technology into everyday life. These challenges affect how many populations interact with the changing media in society and unfortunately leave many at a   disadvantage. This divide between users of new media and those who are unable to access these technologies is also referred to as the digital divide. It leaves low-income families and children at a severe disadvantage that affect them in the present as well as the future. Students for example are largely affected because without access to the Internet or a computer they are unable to do homework and projects and will moreover be unsuccessful in school. These poor grades can lead to frustration with academia and furthermore may lead to delinquent behavior, low income jobs, decreased chanced of pursuing higher educations, and poor job skills.",CAR_99d0516fe722ced12af961ed89b8e78b6b76c4b3,0," K-pop (an abbreviation of Korean pop; ) is a musical genre originating in South Korea that is characterized by a wide variety of audiovisual elements.

Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or ragged, rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called LA Pas Ma LA and it was  released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term ragtime. The term is actually derived from his hometown Shake Rag in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition You've been a good old wagon but you done broke helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896.

The literacy rate in 2001 has been recorded at 64.84% as against 52.21% in 1991. The 12.63 percentage points increase in the literacy rate during the period is the highest increase in any decade. Also for the first time there is a decline in the absolute number of non-literates during the past 10 years. The total number of non literates has come down from 328 million in 1991 to 304 million in 2001. During 1991-2000, the population in 7+ age group increased by 176 millions while 201 million additional persons became literate during that period. Out of 864 million people above the age of 7 years, 560 million are now literates. Three-fourths of our male population and more than half of the female population are literate. This indeed is an encouraging indicator for us to speed up our march towards the goal of achieving a sustainable threshold literacy rate of 75% by 2007.  The Census 2001 provisional figures also indicate that the efforts of the nation during the past decade to remove the scourge of illiteracy have not gone in vain. The eradication of illiteracy from a vast country like India beset by several social and economic hurdles is not an easy task. Realising this the National Literacy Mission was set up on 5 May 1988 to impart a new sense of urgency and seriousness to adult education. After the success of the areas specific, time bound, voluntary based campaign approach first in Kottayam city and then in Ernakulum district in Kerala in 1990, the National Literacy Mission had accepted the literacy campaigns as the dominant strategy for eradication of illiteracy. Out of 600 districts in the country,597 districts have already been covered under Total Literacy Campaigns. The number of continuing education districts is 328. The creditable performance of the National Literacy Mission received international recognition when it was awarded the UNESCO Noma Literacy Prize for 1999. The International Jury while selecting NLM for the prize recognised its initiation of the Total Literacy Campaigns and also its efforts in galvanising activities towards integration, conservation of the environment, promotion of women's equality, and the preservation of family customs and traditions. The Jury also appreciated the training imparted by NLM, the teaching learning material produced by it and the awareness created by it for the demand for raising both the quality and quantity of primary education. The Bureau of Adult Education and National Literacy Mission under the Department of School Education and Literacy of the Ministry of Human Resource Development functions as the Secretariat of the National Literacy Mission Authority. The General Council of the NLMA is headed by the Minister of Human Resource Development and the Executive Council is headed by the Secretary (Elementary Education and Literacy). The Directorate of Adult Education provides necessary technical and resource support to the NLMA. The National Literacy Mission was revitalised with the approval of the Union Government on 30 September 1999. The Mission's goal is to attain total literacy i.e. a sustainable threshold literacy rate of 75% by 2007. The Mission seeks to achieve this by imparting functional literacy to non-literates in the 15-35 age group. To tackle the problem of residual illiteracy, now it has been decided to adopt an integrated approach to Total Literacy Campaigns and Post Literacy Programme. This means the basic literacy campaigns and post literacy programmes will be implemented under one literacy project called 'Literacy Campaigns an Operation Restoration' to achieve continuity, efficiency and convergence and to minimise unnecessary time lag between the two. Post literacy programmes are treated only as a preparatory phase for launching Continuing Education with the ultimate aim of creating a learning society. In order to promote decentralization, the State Literacy Mission Authorities have been given the authority to sanction continuing education projects to Districts and literacy related projects to voluntary agencies in their States. The scheme of Jan Shikshan Sansthan or Institute of People's Education, previously known as the Scheme of Shramik Vidyapeeth was initially evolved as a non-formal continuing education programme to respond to the educational and vocational training needs of adults and young people living in urban and industrial areas and for persons who had migrated from rural to urban settings. Now the Institutes' activities have been enlarged and infrastructure strengthened to enable them to function as district level repositories of vocational and technical skills in both urban and rural areas.

Vocal-driven classic pop replaced Big BandSwing at the end of World War II, although it often used orchestras to back the vocalists.  1940s style Crooners vied with a new generation of big voiced singers, many drawing on Italian bel canto traditions. Mitch Miller, A&R man at the era's most successful label, Columbia Records, set the tone for the development of popular music well into the middle of decade.  Miller integrated country, Western, rhythm & blues, and folk music into the musical mainstream, by having many of his label's biggest artists record them in a style that corresponded to Pop traditions.  Miller often employed novel and ear-catching arrangements featuring classical instruments (whooping french horns, harpsichord), or sound effects (whip cracks).  He approached each record as a miniature story, often casting the vocalist according to type.  ",CAR_a43b4c75c7f07fe7ab3093a9a96904f5df27fb67,0,,

People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music. In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist. Composition is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music score, which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing andor record it from memory.

Blues can be seen as part of a continuum of musical styles like country, jazz, ragtime, and gospel; though each genre evolved into distinct forms, their origins were often indistinct. Early forms of the blues evolved in and around the Mississippi Delta in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The earliest blues music was primarily call and response vocal music, without harmony or accompaniment and without any formal musical structure. Slaves and their descendants created the blues by adapting the field shouts and hollers, turning them into passionate solo songs. When mixed with the Christian spiritual songs of African American churches and revival meetings, blues became the basis of gospel music.

Further technological, economic and social changes led to new forms of music in the 19th century, including the brass band, which produced a popular and communal form of classical music. Similarly, the music hall sprang up to cater for the entertainment of new urban societies, adapting existing forms of music to produce popular songs and acts.

Treating it for the first time with genuine philosophical interest, he gave fresh attention to the industry, its target-marketing to children and teenagers, its top performers, its place in our late-capitalist bourgeois economy, and its pretensions to liberation and freedom.  Some critics, including the popular musician Frank Zappa, argued that Bloom's view of pop music was based on the same ideas that critics of pop in 1950s held, ideas about the preservation of 'traditional' white American society. Bloom, informed by Socrates, Aristotle, Rousseau, and Nietzsche, explores musics power over the human soul. He cites the soldier who throws himself into battle at the urging of the drum corps, the pious believer who prays under the spell of a religious hymn, the lover seduced by the romantic guitar, and points towards the tradition of philosophy that treated musical education as paramount. He names the pop-star Mick Jagger as a cardinal representative of the hypocrisy and erotic sterility of pop-rock music. Pop music employs sexual images and language to enthrall the young and to persuade them that their petty rebelliousness is authentic politics, when, in fact, they are being controlled by the money-managers whom successful performers like Jagger quietly serve. Bloom claims that Jagger is a hero to many university students who envy his fame and wealth but are really just bored by the lack of options before them.

The project was launched in 20092010. This project in fact is the extension of projects undertaken on media literacy in the year 20072008 and 20082009. The first phase of the project focused on the mapping of Media Literacy initiatives across the world. A document was prepared titled Media Literacy initiatives across the world. The document is the collation of print and electronic material available on media literacy initiatives in various part of the world. In case of India, various experts from the field of media, media educators and media literacy experts were interviewed and a comprehensive print report was prepared. In addition to the print report three video programs on media literacy initiatives in India were produced. This phase was followed by the second phase in which reading material was prepared for students as well as teachers.  School teachers were also trained in media literacy. Various media educators and the experts handling media literacy projects were invited to share their experiences with the teachers. The training programs were huge success with more than 100 teachers being trained in face to face mode. That was the first time in India when such training programs on media literacy were organized for teachers. Thereafter, media studies as a subject was introduced in schools as a pilot project. The recently launched third phase (20102011) is the extension of discussion held in first and second phases with the teachers. Teachers who were open to the idea of having media discourse at school level were quite apprehensive of having it in the form of another new subject. According to them introduction of new subject would add to the curriculum load and also they shared their unpreparedness to handle this subject. Then came the concept of establishing media clubs in Schools. At present in India there are around 100 media clubs which are running successfully.

Disregarding media from the school curriculum has always bothered many experts who are working in the field of media studies. Many initiatives were started to introduce children, parents and teachers to the concepts of media studies but all happened out of schools. One of the key point made by the NCF 2005 i.e. connecting knowledge to the life outside the school, has actually opened the door for media studies, a subject which has never in the past was given its due importance in school curriculum. It was realized that students media experiences are as important as their experience with their parents, peers and teachers and by allowing them to bring their media experiences in classroom, a creative environment can be created where they could get a chance to discuss issues which are very integral to their life. It will enable the students to see behind the screen and read between the lines and to be an active citizen of the world's largest democracy.The vision of democracy articulated by the Secondary Education Commission (1952) is worth recalling here and how media understanding fits into the vision is motivating enough for those who would be interested in taking this initiative forward.Citizenship in a democracy involves many intellectual, social and moral qualities... a democratic citizen should have the understanding and the intellectual integrity to sift truth from falsehood, facts from propaganda and to reject the dangerous appeal of fanaticism and prejudiceThis is what media literacy initiatives world over propagates. The strategies to implement them may vary in different countries but the idea is to make students to reflect critically on media issues. It entails the acceptance of multiple views on social issues and commitment to democratic forms of interaction and helps children to see issues from different perspectives and understand how such issues are connected to their lives. The content and language of media products provide ways of looking at the world. The media is a hidden curriculum for students which should be explored.This has been explored in many countries and is called by various names in different parts of the world like television literacy, critical viewership skills, critical viewing skills. These projects were started with the initiative of an individual or small group and later on it attracted like minded people and became success. In fact a media study is one of the fastest growing subject which need to be introduced not only at college or university level but also at school level. Undoubtedly it is important to engage students in media discourse and the subject needs to be taken to school but then it has its own challenges. First, most teachers are unfamiliar with the subject and are poorly equipped to teach this subject as the subject is not a part of Bachelor of Education or Master of education curriculum. Second, introduction of one more subject may increase curriculum load on students. Keeping in view the need for media discourse at school level and the challenges, a media club in school can provide a solution. Both media educators and teachers can be involved in setting up and running of the Media Clubs. A community based learning (CBL) approach is proposed with the goal of engaging multiple elements involved in the community in learning process including local newspaper, channels, colleges, parents and teachers. At present Media clubs are running in Delhi, Kerela and West Bengal. In year 20112012 project will be extended to all states in India. The purpose is to promote media literacy across the nation. Participation of other states in this project will have the following benefits:Sharing of the experience of already established media clubs with other states.Participating states can get information on development and planning aspect of media clubs from the Delhi experience.States can share their experiences and handle state specific issues while talking about media literacy.Students and teachers of different states will be connected with each other while working on media literacy projects.",CAR_f3fd4d33634d1bb390676fb6acefb077f5616654,0," One program that integrates music in education is the Changing Education Through the Arts (CETA) program, which is done through the Kennedy Center.

Technological consciousness situates new understandings by creating a context of time and space. As well, technological consciousness organizes disjointed sequences of experience under a sense of unity that allows for a continuity of experience. The aspectual component of technological consciousness recognizes that individuals can only be conscious of aspects of an experience, not the whole thing. For this reason, technology manifests itself in processes that can be shared with others. The integrative characteristics of technological consciousness are assimilation, substitution and conversation. Assimilation allows for unfamiliar experiences to be integrated with familiar ones. Substitution is a metaphorical process allowing for complex experiences to be codified and shared with others  for example, language.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the  term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.",CAR_f6d332e630063cc0dad352ef993d25b372e2bee7,0," Out of this course emerged what was claimed to be the first classroom textbook in pop music, Pop Workbook, co-written by Farmer and Tony Attwood and first published in 1978.

The field of pop music developed tremendously during this period, as the increasingly low price of recorded music stimulated demand and greater profits for the record industry.  As a result, music marketing became more and more prominent, resulting in a number of mainstream pop stars whose popularity was previously unheard of.  Many of the first such stars were Italian-American crooners like Dean Martin, Rudy Vallee, Tony Bennett, Perry Como, Frankie Laine and, most famously, the first pop vocalist to engender hysteria among his fans Frank Sinatra. The era of the modern teen pop star, however, began in the 1960s. Bubblegum pop groups like The Monkees were chosen entirely for their appearance and ability to sell records, with no regard to musical ability.  The same period, however, also saw the rise of new forms of pop music that achieved a more permanent presence in the field of American popular music, including rock, soul and pop-folk. By the end of the 1960s, two developments had completely changed popular music: the birth of a counterculture, which explicitly opposed mainstream music, often in tandem with political and social activism, and the shift from professional composers to performers who were both singers and songwriters.",CAR_0c5d4aaaf35a86e8a14d4b31198b41bac4d010c6,0," The history and origins of traditional Irish music.

Kelefah Sanneh of The New York Times wrote that rather than being the song's focal point, Aaliyah knew how to disappear into the music, how to match her voice to the bass line, and consequently helped change the way popular music sounds; the twitchy, beat-driven songs of Destiny's Child owe a clear debt to 'Are You That Somebody'. Sanneh asserted that by the time of her death in 2001, Aaliyah had recorded some of the most innovative and influential pop songs of the last five years.

The Who was labelled the first pop art band by their manager, while member Pete Townshend explains: We stand for pop art clothes, pop art music and pop art behaviour ... we don't change offstage; we live pop art. Frith considers their album The Who Sell Out (1967) perhaps the Pop art pop masterpiece, the Who using the vitality of commerce itself, a tactic echoed by Roy Wood's the Move and, later, Kevin Godley and Lol Creme's 10cc. Townshend's ideas were notable for their emphasis on commercialism: his use of Pop art rhetoric ... referred not to music-making as such  to the issue of self-expression  but to commercial music-making, to issues of packaging, selling and publicizing, to the problems of popularity and stardom.

According to AllMusic, early emo bands were hardcore bands that favored expressive vocals over the typical barking rants of regular hardcore and most 1990s emo bands borrowed from some combination of Fugazi, Sunny Day Real Estate, and Weezer.

It also explored the consequences of new technology and social change in the electronic music of synthpop. In the early years of the decade, while subgenres like heavy metal music continued to develop separately, there was a considerable crossover between rock and more commercial popular music, with a large number of more serious bands, like The Police and UB40, enjoying considerable single chart success. The advent of MTV and cable video helped spur what has been seen as a Second British Invasion in the early years of the decade, with British bands enjoying more success in America than they had since the height of The Beatles' popularity in the 1960s. However, by the end of the decade there was a fragmentation, with many new forms of music and sub-cultures, including Hip Hop and House music, while the single charts were once again dominated by pop artists, now often associated with the Hi-NRG hit factory of Stock Aitken Waterman.

It has sold more than 32 million copies worldwide, making it one of the highest-selling albums of all time. In a 1987 review for Q magazine, the music journalist and author Charles Shaar Murray asserted that the album remains a central pillar of the mythology and iconography of the late '60s. That same year Rolling Stone Anthony DeCurtis described it as an enormous achievement that revolutionized rock and roll. In 1994, Sgt. Pepper was ranked first in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. He described it as the album that revolutionized, changed and re-invented the boundaries of modern popular music.

Many commentators stated that the band's polished pop sound only remotely resembled punk music. Although the video for All the Small Things was filmed as a mockery of boy bands and teen pop, fame didn't discriminate based on origin: soon the group was as famous as those it was parodying. Blink now had the backing of a major record company ... just like the synthesized pop acts they were spoofing, said British journalist Tim Footman.

Matt Diehl, author of the book My So-Called Punk, called the basis for satire thin: To seasoned ears, Blink-182 sounded and looked just as manufactured as the pop idols they were poking fun at. The band faced a backlash shortly after Enema of the State was released from several punk and emo acts who wished to not be associated with their music. Tristin Laughter, employee of Bay Area record label Lookout!

The corporate nature surrounding popular music streamlined it into a framework that focused on slight deviations from the accepted norm, creating what Adorno calls pseudo-individualism; what the public would perceive as unique or organic would musically comply with standard, established musical conventions. Thus, a duality emerged from this standardization, an industry-driven manipulation of the publics tastes to give people what they want while simultaneously guiding them to it. In the case of rock music, while the genre may have grown out of politicized forces and another form of meaningful motivation, the corporate influence over popular music became integral to its identity that directing public taste became increasingly easier. Technological developments allowed for easy dispersion of western music, causing the dominance of western music into rural and urbanized areas across the globe. However, because popular music assumes such a corporatized role and therefore remains subject to a large degree of standardization, ambiguity exists whether the music reflects actual cultural values or those only of the corporate sector seeking economic profit. Because popular music developed such a dependent relationship with media and the corporations surrounding it, where record sales and profit indirectly shaped musical decisions, the superstar person became an important element of popular music. From the fame and economic success surrounding such superstars, subcultures continued to arise, such as the rock and punk movements, only perpetuated by the corporate machine that also shaped the musical aspect of popular music.",CAR_7065b196e2f4c33c9aa288b543163e5b0364847c,0," Stukas and Zaiko Langa Langa were the two most influential bands to emerge from this era, with Zaiko Langa Langa being an important starting ground for musicians like Pepe Feli, Bozi Boziana, Evoloko Jocker and Papa Wemba.

The music charts contain songs from a variety of sources, including classical, jazz, rock, and novelty songs. Pop music, as a genre, is seen as existing and developing separately. Thus pop music may be used to describe a distinct genre, aimed at a youth market, often characterized as a softer alternative to rock and roll. Musicologist Allan Moore surmises that the term pop music itself may have originated from Pop art. Additionally, it's important to note that pop music is always evolving, which means that the definition of pop music can change, too. It's also important to be cognizant of the distinction between pop music and popular music.

G-Dragon later stated that they hoped to reach even more fans with the new direction.  In an interview, the group also expressed interest in covering the music genre trot.  From their EP Hot Issue (2007), the shibuya-kei-influenced Fool (Korean: ; Revised Romanization: Babo) contained a heavy dance beat paired with a smooth disco coating, with G-Dragon's falsetto in the song garnering praise as a pleasant surprise. Day by Day from Stand Up (2008) was admired for weaving in and out of tempos seamlessly and forcing a sense of anxiety on the listener through the beating undercurrent and hailed as an experiential masterpiece. They also collaborated with the Korean rock-band No Brain for Oh My Friend, a rock-based song.  Alive (2012) was noted for being more experimental than their previous materials, with Blue being distinguished for including more interesting electronic samples and production techniques and Bad Boy described as having a nostalgic sentiment, being called a perfect pop song, that transcends language.  The album was also praised for showcasing the group's voice instead of their usual autotune, being described as having a mature kind of intensity. Their song Monster was praised for its use of the piano and orchestra sound and the composition for Bingle Bingle (Korean: ; Revised Romanization: Binggeul Binggeul) was noted for being electronic and retro, similar to the work of Katy Perry and Daft Punk.  The group mixed a variety electronic music with soft rock for their Made (2015) series. Loser was cited for introducing a more mature style to the group without losing the images they had enforced through previous releases, while Bang Bang Bang was acclaimed for its EDM-inspired sound and Bae Bae for its boundary-pushing elements. In Let's Not Fall in Love, Big Bang was complimented for being at their most tender, with the song being described as having a lush production that evokes a range of emotions.Members of the band have branched out to other styles for solo projects, thus the group has been described as rich in variety for their fans.  Taeyang's EP Hot was mainly a collection of R&B songs, with the singer stating that this genre was his main focus.  Daesung's first digital single, Look at Me, GwiSoon (Korean:  , , Revised Romanization: Nal Bwa Gwisoon), was a trot song, which drew criticism due to Big Bang's image as hip-hop artists.  For his debut album, Heartbreaker, G-Dragon incorporated a mix of dance, hip-hop, and R&B songs.  Justin Mccurry from The Guardian said that each of the five members has his own individual look, and their musical range is equally eclectic, covering R&B, hip-hop, house, electro and pop.  Producer and rapper Cho PD expressed appreciation for the group, stating how idol singers like Big Bang possess the ability to be musicians.  He was particularly fond of G-Dragon, citing the rapper as the main representative for the group's growth. Additionally, they have been described as artistic superheroes for showing versatility and success in whatever they do by rivaling companies. Their continued experimentation with a diverse range of musical styles and their distinct personalities have been highlighted as some of the main reasons for their popularity and longevity.  Mark James Russell, an entertainment journalist based in Seoul, praised the group for defying categorization, stating how of all the mainstream acts, theyre doing the most to push boundaries of what is considered K-pop.  Internationally, Big Bang is often referred to as a K-pop group, a label which they do not appreciate, with G-Dragon commenting that, We are Korean, so obviously they call our music K-pop.

These groups were all heavily influenced by American rock 'n' roll, blues, and R&Bmusical genres they had been introduced to via homegrown British rock 'n' roll singers, imported American records, and the music of the skiffle craze.  While rock 'n' roll and, to a lesser extent, blues were still popular in the UK, for many young Americans these genres had either become somewhat dmod, as was the case with rock 'n' roll, or were largely unknown to white audiences, as was the case with the blues.  These UK groups, known collectively as the British Invasion, reintroduced American youth culture to the broad potential of rock and pop music as a creative medium and to the wealth of musical culture to be found within the United States.  In addition, a number of the British Invasion bands also wrote their own pop- and R&B-flavored material, something that was rarely done at the time and something that would prove to be influential on many U.S. bands as the 1960s progressed.",CAR_8543f682b5f80fd060e5420d792015ab9bd71430,0,,

Nevertheless, a number of established Canadian acts, including Rush, BachmanTurner Overdrive, Frank Marino & Mahogany Rush, Bruce Cockburn, April Wine, Pat Travers, FM, and Neil Young, remained influential and recorded some of their most popular material of all during this period, and former The Guess Who lead singer Burton Cummings emerged as a popular solo artist in soft rock. Also notable is folk rocker Gordon Lightfoot's The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald, a song written in commemoration of the sinking of the bulk carrier SS Edmund Fitzgerald on Lake Superior on 10 November 1975. The incident is the most famous disaster in the history of Great Lakes shipping. The single reached #2 on the Billboard pop charts in November 1976, making it Lightfoot's second most successful (in terms of chart position) single, with Sundown having reached number one in 1974.

AllMusic distinguishes pop metal, which refers to the whole pop-tinted hard rock and heavy metal scene of the 1980s (including Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, Europe), from hair metal, the characteristics of which are flashy clothing and heavy makeup (as embodied by Poison, and Mtley Cre).

Like American pop music it has a focus on commercial recording, often orientated towards a youth market, as well as that of the Singles Chart usually through the medium of relatively short and simple love songs. While these basic elements of the genre have remained fairly constant, pop music has absorbed influences from most other forms of popular music, particularly borrowing from the development of rock music, and utilising key technological innovations to produce new variations on existing themes.

Debut didn't just establish Bjrk; it helped make sounds like that cool to a segment of the music-dork universe that mightve remained deaf to its charms otherwise.

Several important and influential subgenres were created in Britain in this period, by pursuing the possibilities of rock music, including electric folk and glam rock, a process that reached its apogee in the development of progressive rock and one of the most enduring subgenres in heavy metal music. While jazz began to suffer a decline in popularity in this period, Britain began to be increasingly influenced by aspects of World music, including Jamaican music, resulting in new music scenes and subgenres. In the middle years of the decade the influence of the pub rock led to the British intensification of punk, which swept away much of the existing landscape of popular music, replacing it with much more diverse new wave and post punk bands who mixed different forms of music and influences to dominate rock and pop music into the 1980s.",CAR_b8394ae33e688d4c2f43186e99d3493e17f3ed67,0," Soft Machine are  an English rock and jazz fusion band from Canterbury, named after the book The Soft Machine by William S.

By the mid-1980s, several bands merged hardcore punk with pop music to create a new, faster pop punk sound such as Dag Nasty, the Nip Drivers, T.S.O.L., Social Distortion, and the Descendents. Pop punk in the United States began to grow in popularity locally in California in the mid to late 1980s. Pop punk particularly thrived in California, where independent record labels adopted a do it yourself (DIY) approach to releasing music.

By 1994, pop punk was quickly growing in mainstream popularity. The late 1990s, exemplified by the 1999 release of Blink-182's Enema of the State, represented the genre's mainstream peak, although some pop punk bands scored successful album chartings in the 2000s.

The earliest known example of a rock journalist using the term was Dave Marsh who used it to describe the music of Question Mark and the Mysterians in the May 1971 issue of Creem magazine, and it was adopted by several influential rock music journalists in the early 1970s to describe 60s garage bands and more contemporary acts influenced by them.In the liner notes of the 1972 anthology album Nuggets, critic and guitarist Lenny Kaye uses the term punk-rock to refer to the mid-60s garage rock groups, as well as some of the darker and more primitive practitioners of 1960s psychedelic rock.",CAR_c78aeb60eead00aee7040623c53697f73605f64c,0," Emo is a style of rock music characterized by melodic musicianship and expressive, often confessional lyrics.

Bands dubbed alternative had no unified style, but were all seen as distinct from mainstream music. Alternative bands were linked by their collective debt to punk rock, through hardcore, New Wave or the post-punk movements. Important bands of the 1980s alternative movement in the US included R.E.M., Hsker D, Jane's Addiction, Sonic Youth and the Pixies. Artists were largely confined to independent record labels, building an extensive underground music scene based on college radio, fanzines, touring, and word-of-mouth. Few of these bands, with the exception of R.E.M., achieved mainstream success, but despite a lack of spectacular album sales, they exerted a considerable influence on the generation of musicians who came of age in the 80s and ended up breaking through to mainstream success in the 1990s. Styles of alternative rock in the U.S. during the 1980s included jangle pop, associated with the early recordings of R.E.M., which incorporated the ringing guitars of mid-1960s pop and rock, and college rock, used to describe alternative bands that began in the college circuit and college radio, including acts such as 10,000 Maniacs and The Feelies.",CAR_d1605e86ce87fd5e5a05efbb948ef970417b40fe,0," One Direction's debut studio album, Up All Night (2011), is predominantly a pop music record, containing elements of teen pop, dance-pop, pop rock, with electropop and rock influences.

In addition to his late 1960s band, Nazz, some of Todd Rundgren's early 1970s solo work touched on power pop, as did the recordings of Blue Ash, the Flamin' Groovies, Artful Dodger and, in particular, the Dwight Twilley Band (whose hit I'm on Fire is emblematic of the genre's hybridity). The most influential group of the period may have been Big Star.

Further technological, economic and social changes led to new forms of music in the 19th century, including the brass band, which produced a popular and communal form of classical music. Similarly, the music hall sprang up to cater for the entertainment of new urban societies, adapting existing forms of music to produce popular songs and acts.

This was previously an explicitly anti-mainstream grouping of genres that rose to great fame beginning in the early 1990s. The genre in its early stages was largely situated on Sub Pop Records, a company founded by Bruce Pavitt and John Poneman. Significant grunge bands signed to the label were Green River (half of the members from this band would later become founding members of Pearl Jam), Sonic Youth (although not a grunge band they were influential on grunge bands and in fact it was upon the insistence of Kim Gordon that the David Geffen Company signed Nirvana) and Nirvana. Grunge is an alternative rock subgenre with a dark, brooding guitar-based sludge sound, drawing on heavy metal, punk, and elements of bands like Sonic Youth and their use of unconventional tunings to bend otherwise standard pop songs completely out of shape. With the addition of a melodic, Beatlesque element to the sound of bands like Nirvana, grunge became wildly popular across the United States. Grunge became commercially successful in the early 1990s, peaking between 1991 and 1994. Bands from cities in the U.S. Pacific Northwest especially Seattle, Washington, were responsible for creating grunge and later made it popular with mainstream audiences. The supposed Generation X, who had just reached adulthood as grunge's popularity peaked, were closely associated with grunge, the sound which helped define the desperation of (that) generation. Later Post Grunge bands such as Foo Fighters and Creed became popular form of Alternative rock because it was and still is very radio friendly unlike the Grunge band of which they were musically influenced by. Pop punk bands like Green Day and Blink 182 also gained popularity. In the second half of the 1990s nu metal arose with bands such as Linkin Park, Korn, Limp Bizkit and Slipknot.

Britain also began to be increasingly influenced by aspects of World music, including Jamaican and Indian music, resulting in new music scenes and subgenres.

One of the first critically acclaimed acts was the rock band Super Nova from Skopje which utilized rap music elements in some of its songs. The group recorded several rap music tracks for the music production branch of the Macedonian Radio-Television, including Hip-hop blues, Rap, Vero and others, some including pop, rock, funk, reggae or other elements. Part of the songs were in Macedonian language, while some were released in Serbo-Croatian for promotion across the wider former Yugoslav market. One of those songs was the anti-war themed Rapovanje. Its catchy rhyme Bolje da se rapuje, nego da se ratuje (Better to do rapping, than to wage a war) made it very popular across the country in 1989.Currently, one of the notable underground hip hop performers and producers in the Republic of Macedonia is Vladimir Agovski-Ago from Skopje. He became involved in the Macedonian hip-hop scene since childhood as a very young b-boy in 1986. In the following year he formed a juvenile rap act called The Masters of Rap and recorded his first studio track in 1988. In 1991 he joined the band Instant Beat, which performed around the country and made recordings in the Macedonian Radio-Television production, which were never officially released. Later, he formed another group The Most Wanted which in 1995 released the first Macedonian hardcore rap album, called Judgment Day. After the group disbanded in 1996, he continued to work under the name Temnata strana (The Dark Side) and he founded the first Macedoninan hip-hop label, called Dolina na senkite abbreviated DNS (Valley of the Shadows) to promote his own works and other upcoming Macedonian hip hop acts as well.The group ista okolina was formed in 1989 by joining several previously existing juvenile rap bands, and later it rose to one of the most prominent hip hop acts in the country. ista okolina released the album Noviot aspekt na starata kola (The New Aspect of the Old School) in the spring of 1996. During its existence it also released a song together with the prominent alternative rock group Last Expedition. One of the ista okolina's former members Vele Solunev later became a frontman of the mixed-style music group appropriately named Mosaique, because it combined various elements such as hip hop, jazz fusion, alternative rock and ethno-jazz.One of the most successful hip hop acts in the country is SAF (Sakam Afro Frizura) formed in 1993. It consists of the emcees Smilen Dimitrov and Mitko Gatarovski aka Pikisipi, as well as the band's backing DJ and turntablist, Goce Trpkov. In 1996 they released their well-known anti-drug abuse theme called Miss Stone. Its title is a pun between the historical person Miss Stone, the US missionary who met Jane Sandanski in Macedonia in the 1900s, and the phrase stoned. As the group became critically acclaimed, in the following year they started a music TV show called Hiphop teza. They released their debut album titled Safizam in 2001 and played a promotional concert with the prominent US hip hop band Das EFX as a support act.Prominent Macedonian hip hop artists in the 2000s include: Da Daka Nakot, Legijata, Klan Istok, Edinstvena opcija, Puka kozmetika, Green Out, Speeding Bee, Str2 and many others.The early 1990s saw the emergence of many Macedonian pop-rap artists influenced by the then-popular MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice.

Behind most of these successful pop-rap acts was the prominent Macedonian composer and producer Toe Pop Simonov. The group Nulta Pozitiv was formed in parallel. Gradually they went more and more mainstream and became popular across the country, especially after recording the rap track nicknamed after the famous Macedonian folk song Otvori go Pendereto (Open the Window). It featured an unconventional refrain for a rap song sung by the notable folk music singer Mirko Mitrevski. They released an album titled Transfuzija. Later emerged another pop-rap artist Kristijan Gabrovski from Prilep nicknamed Risto Bombata after Afrika Bambaataa. He and his backing band became very popular across the country for their mix of rap, pop-rock and pop-folk. In the mid-1990s an offshoot of Nulta Pozitiv was the more harder-sounding group named Attack which released the famous song Atentatot na Kiro after the assassination-attempt on the then-President of the Republic of Macedonia Kiro Gligorov in 1995. Later, one of the former Nulta Pozitiv members, Darko Dimitrov rose to a prominent Macedonian composer and producer. Among others, he also worked with the late 1990searly 2000s pop-rap artists such as Vrak and Ugro.One of the first prominent Macedonian rap music festivals was the so-called Rap'n'Roll fest which was held in the early 1990s in MKC, the Youth Cultural Centre in Skopje, followed by many others.

The movement developed as a reaction against various musical and cultural trends in the late 1980s and early 1990s, particularly the grunge phenomenon from the United States. New British groups such as Suede and Blur launched the movement by positioning themselves as opposing musical forces, referencing British guitar music of the past and writing about uniquely British topics and concerns. These bands were soon joined by others including Oasis, Pulp, Supergrass and Elastica. Britpop groups brought British alternative rock into the mainstream and formed the backbone of a larger British cultural movement called Cool Britannia. Although its more popular bands were able to spread their commercial success overseas, especially to the United States, the movement largely fell apart by the end of the decade. After the decline of Britpop, British indie was kept alive by post pop bands including Radiohead, Feeder, Stereophonics and Travis, who largely abandoned the elements of national and retro-60s culture.

Britain has influenced popular music disproportionately to its size, due to its linguistic and cultural links with many countries, particularly the United States and many of its former colonies like Australia, South Africa, and Canada, and its capacity for invention, innovation and fusion, which has led to the development of, or participation in, many of the major trends in popular music. In the early-20th century, influences from the United States became most dominant in popular music, with young performers producing their own versions of American music, including rock n' roll from the late 1950s and developing a parallel music scene. This is particularly true since the early 1960s when the British Invasion, led by The Beatles, helped to secure British performers a major place in development of pop and rock music. Since then, rock music and popular music contributed to a British-American collaboration, with trans-Atlantic genres being exchanged and exported to one another, where they tended to be adapted and turned into new movements, only to be exported back again.

Many of the 1980s skate punk bands were hardcore punk bands. In the 1990s, skate punk changed and was played by bands that sound more like pop punk and standard punk rock than hardcore punk. Also a skater subculture, skate punk's origins go back to skate culture and surf culture.

Blast beats and fast drumming are very common in skate punk. Skate punk features the fast tempos of hardcore punk and melodic hardcore, occasionally combining them with the catchy hooks of pop punk. Some skate punk bands play other genres of music; pop punk, funk metal and hardcore punk are genres that are noted for being played by some skate punk bands.

After being signed, the band headed immediately into the studio with Zack Odem, Kenneth Mount (All Time Low, Mayday Parade), and Mike Green (Paramore, Breathe Carolina) to record their debut  EP Hello World, which was released on May 25, 2010. The EP consisted of eight catchy tracks that introduced the bands melodic, pop rock-influenced sound. At this point, lead singer Pizzaro, compared their music to pop-rock bands such as The All American Rejects and Jimmy Eat World and wanted his band to have mass appeal without any age range, gender, or mindset restrictions. We want to be a mature poprock band with a sound that kids can get into, but adults will also enjoy, Pizarro notes.

It was initially dubbed as 'C86' after the 1986 NME tape, and also known as cutie, shambling bands and later as twee pop. Indie pop was characterised by jangling guitars, a love of sixties pop and often fey, innocent lyrics. The UK label Sarah Records and its most popular band The Field Mice, although more diverse than the label indicates, were probably its most typical proponents. It was also inspired by the DIY scene of punk and there was a thriving fanzine, label and club and gig circuit. Genres such as Riot Grrrl and bands as diverse as Nirvana, Manic Street Preachers, and Belle and Sebastian have all acknowledged its influence. A further development was Dream pop, which followed  bands like Cocteau Twins, The Chameleons, The Passions, Dif Juz, Lowlife and A.R. Kane began fusing post-punk and ethereal experiments with bittersweet pop melodies into sensual, sonically ambitious soundscapes. A louder, more aggressive strain of dream pop came to be known as shoegazing; key bands of this style were Lush, Slowdive, My Bloody Valentine, Chapterhouse, Curve and Levitation. These bands kept the atmospheric qualities of dream pop, but added the intensity of post-punk-influenced bands such as The Chameleons and Sonic Youth.",CAR_4952ae6821ebafc51e22859f7eeff497b25e10db,0," While emo originated in hardcore punk and has been considered a subgenre of post-hardcore, it has also been associated with indie rock and pop punk. The fusion of emo with pop punk is also known as emo pop. According to AllMusic, some emo leans toward the progressive side, full of complex guitar work, unorthodox song structures, arty noise, and extreme dynamic shifts; some emo is much closer to punk-pop, though it's a bit more intricate. Lyrics, which are a key focus in the genre, are typically emotional and often personal, dealing with topics such as failed romance; AllMusic described emo lyrics as usually either free-associative poetry or intimate confessionals. According to AllMusic, early emo bands were hardcore bands that favored expressive vocals over the typical barking rants of regular hardcore and most 1990s emo bands borrowed from some combination of Fugazi, Sunny Day Real Estate, and Weezer. The New York Times described as emo as emotional punk or post-hardcore or pop-punk. That is, punk that wears its heart on its sleeve and tries a little tenderness to leaven its sonic attack. If it helps, imagine Ricky Nelson singing in the Sex Pistols.

Protopunk and power pop bands of the late 1960s and early 1970s helped lay the groundwork for the pop punk sound, which emerged at the onset of punk rock around 1974 with the Ramones. The Beatles, the Kinks and the Beach Boys all paved the way for pop punk. With their love of the Beach Boys and late 1960s bubblegum pop, the Ramones paved the way to what became known as pop punk. The Ramones' loud and fast melodic minimalism differentiated them from other bands in New York City's budding art rock scene, but pop punk was not considered a separate subgenre until later.

This is the style most generally associated with The Mr. T Experience. His compositions cover a variety of topics but are concerned primarily with personal relationships; he is known to introduce much of his material with the throwaway line This is a song about a girl. Over the years his other musical tastes and interests have pushed the band to explore many styles, branching out from the Bay Area pop punk sound which he helped define. This change is evidenced on a number of solo acoustic songs interspersed between the pop punk standards on most of the band's late-1990s albums.

Many commentators stated that the band's polished pop sound only remotely resembled punk music. Although the video for All the Small Things was filmed as a mockery of boy bands and teen pop, fame didn't discriminate based on origin: soon the group was as famous as those it was parodying.

The band faced a backlash shortly after Enema of the State was released from several punk and emo acts who wished to not be associated with their music. Tristin Laughter, employee of Bay Area record label Lookout!

The cover later appeared on the deluxe edition of the band's second studio album Hello Fascination (2010).",CAR_6d5e6d2eb663b097c68d2fcbbc9bf399d3eb6ac5,1," The popular music scene at the time included such teen-pop bands as the Allies (whose song Emma Peel received a good deal of local play, but never broke out nationally) and the Heaters (later the Heats). That same era saw the more sophisticated pop of the short-lived Visible Targets and the still-performing Young Fresh Fellows and The Posies; the pop-punk of The Fastbacks; and the outright punk of the Fartz (later Ten Minute Warning).",CAR_6e805b4e39ff08b0a38570b6c6d8af558655a3e9,1," After the breakthrough of punk rock in the 1990s, by the 2000s the genre had evolved more into pop punk due to major label records taking interest and signing on bands such as Blink-182. Green Day kick-started the 2000s with the release of their sixth studio album Warning in 2000 to lukewarm success. The following year, Blink-182 released their fourth studio album Take Off Your Pants And Jacket in 2001 which went on to sell 14 million copies worldwide. It was a commercial and critical success, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 within its first week of release and securing the status of the pop punk trio as one of biggest bands of the genre.  Also in that year, Canadian band Sum 41 released their debut album All Killer, No Filler, which went platinum in the United States. The second-wave bands dominated the pop punk genre in the early years with bands like Good Charlotte, New Found Glory, Simple Plan and Sum 41 receiving platinum status and gaining a large fan bases worldwide. In 2002, Avril Lavigne became popular in the pop punk scene thanks to her pop punk based sound, and was arguably the most prominent artist to take this new direction in pop music, with hits such as Complicated and Sk8er Boi. In 2003, Blink-182 released their untitled album blink-182, which demonstrated a darker and more mature tone than previous albums. This was mainly due to the side-project Box Car Racer. Even so, the album was yet another commercial and critical success. It was to be their last album released before taking an indefinite hiatus in 2005. The band would reunite four years later. After their 1994 breakthrough, Green Day's fame was fading, mainly due to rising popularity of other bands like Good Charlotte and Sum 41. Realising this, they retreated to the studio and produced their seventh studio album American Idiot released in 2004. It saw a significant sales boost, selling 14 million copies worldwide. Fall Out Boy's From Under The Cork Tree gained commercial success in 2005 and put the band on the pop punk map. The last successful pop punk album of the decade was Green Day's eighth studio album 21st Century Breakdown released in 2009 which achieved their best chart performance to date by reaching number one on the album charts of various countries, including the United States Billboard 200, the European Top 100 Albums, and the United Kingdom Albums Chart.",CAR_6fa948c06b8c59c9824bfcaba31f9cafa6e6600c,1," In the early 2000s, there was an astounding resurgence of interest in pop rock and power pop. This was kickstarted in the year 2000 with the success of Blink-182's song All the Small Things and Nine Days's song Absolutely (Story of a Girl), both of which peaked at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100. The trend kicked off the brief musical careers of Ryan Cabrera, Ashley Parker Angel, Teddy Geiger, Evan and Jaron, The Click Five, Jet, and Snow Patrolthroughout the early and mid 2000s. This also paved the way for a second wave of pop punk bands such as Good Charlotte, New Found Glory, and Sum 41, who made use of humor in their videos and had a radio-friendly tone to their music, while retaining the speed, attitude and even the look of 1970s punk. Later pop-punk bands such as Simple Plan, The All-American Rejects and Fall Out Boy had a sound that had been described as closer to late 1970s and early 1980s hardcore, with similarities to the band Cheap Trick, while still achieving considerable commercial success.

Music, while Some Things Come From Nothing is a post-punk dub track that was called the closest a rock band will come to the cracked ambience of Aphex Twin by the NME. Fire in My Heart has been described by Rhys as a country and western song, while Mojo has called it trad-sounding folk music. The Melody Maker called the album's closer Keep the Cosmic Trigger Happy psych pop and likened Chewing Chewing Gum to the second side of Roxy Music's debut album. Night Vision is the most aggressive-sounding song on the album according to Rhys. The track has been called garage rock by the Melody Maker and punk rock by both Allmusic and Yahoo! Music, with the latter comparing the song to She's Lost Control by Joy Division. First single Northern Lites is a calypso-inspired track. Critics have commented on the song's use of Tijuana brass, reminiscent of the work of Herb Alpert, and likened the track to the music of Burt Bacharach and Hal David and the Beck single Deadweight.",CAR_a0bc13fe47eff57bee7b108fcbf337e114db31c6,0," Green Day's sound is often compared to first wave punk rock bands such as the Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, The Jam, and the Buzzcocks. Stylistically, the group is characterized as punk rock, pop punk and alternative rock. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described Green Day as punk revivalists who recharged the energy of speedy, catchy three-chord punk-pop songs. While Armstrong is the primary songwriter, he looks to the other band members for organizational help. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned that some of his biggest influences are seminal alternative rock bands Hsker D and The Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. Green Day has covered Hsker D's Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely as a b-side to the Warning single, and the character Mr. Whirly in the group's song Misery is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Among other influences, Green Day have also cited The Kinks, The Who and power pop pioneers Cheap Trick.

One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys. In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991 R.E.M. hit Losing My Religion was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts), Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and the Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin, most notably on the Black Crowes song Locust Street. Armenian American rock group System of A Down makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album MezmerizeHypnotize. Pop punk band Green Day has used a mandolin in several occasions, especially on their 2000 album, Warning. Boyd Tinsley, violin player of the Dave Matthews Band has been using an electric mandolin since 2005. Frontman Colin Meloy and guitarist Chris Funk of the Decemberists regularly employ the mandolin in the band's music. Nancy Wilson, rhythm guitarist of Heart, uses a mandolin in Heart's song Dream of the Archer from the album Little Queen, as well as in Heart's cover of Led Zeppelin's song The Battle of Evermore. Show Me Heaven by Maria McKee, the theme song to the film Days of Thunder, prominently features a mandolin.

By the mid-1980s, several bands merged hardcore punk with pop music to create a new, faster pop punk sound such as Dag Nasty, the Nip Drivers, T.S.O.L., Social Distortion, and the Descendents. Pop punk in the United States began to grow in popularity locally in California in the mid to late 1980s. Pop punk particularly thrived in California, where independent record labels adopted a do it yourself (DIY) approach to releasing music. By the mid 1990s, a few pop punk bands had started to sell millions of records and receive extensive radio and television airplay, such as Green Day. By 1994, pop punk was quickly growing in mainstream popularity. The late 1990s, exemplified by the 1999 release of Blink-182's Enema of the State, represented the genre's mainstream peak, although some pop punk bands scored successful album chartings in the 2000s.

They are considered one of the most important Chilean bands,  and arguably the strongest musical influences that Chile has made to Latin American music.  In addition, they are considered by Latin American media and musicians pioneers of Rock en espaol (Rock in Spanish) and the band with strongest socio-political impact in Chile. Their roots date back to March 1979, when their core members entered high school. From their beginnings in 1983 at the Festival de la Cancin del Colegio Miguel Len Prado (Miguel Leon Prado High School Song festival) to their first limited release album in Chile under the record label Fusin Producciones, they struggled to make themselves known until they were able to sign with EMI Records in 1985, re-releasing their first album on LP record and cassette. From that point on, they reached mainstream success in Chile, then in Peru. Los Prisioneros created a simple Punk sound with a mix of  Nueva ola, Techno, Synthpop, and Reggae. Musically, Los Prisioneros marked the beginning of a new musical era in Chile, leaving behind the 1960s folk-inspired music of Vctor Jara and Violeta Parra, and starting the new era of Nuevo Pop Chileno (New Chilean Pop). Their legacy has been recognised by bands such as Glup!, Javiera y Los Imposibles, Lucybell, Los Tetas and La Ley, who together made the tribute album Tributo a Los Prisioneros. They made themselves known for having controversial songs that criticized socio-economic structures, education, economic policies, as well as societal attitudes of Chile and Latin America. Their songs were used by Chilean young people to protest the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Because of this, Chilean mainstream media banned the group's music between 1985 and 1990, but their music continued to spread in Chile, aided in part by word of mouth and by shared homemade cassette copies. Many Los Prisoneros compositions are among the most important and musically influential songs of Latin America, and Rock en espaol, particularly the songs We Are Sudamerican Rockers and Tren al Sur, and especially El Baile De Los Que Sobran.",CAR_c8661dc1134a6c14ba8dbde2e522187de052230d,0," The band's style has been disputed by fans because of the complex combination of different musical styles and the more mature, serious, and heavy sound in later albums. The band's EP Half Hour of Power is described as punk rock, skate punk and pop punk. All Killer, No Filler was described as pop punk and skate punk. Does This Look Infected? has been described as punk rock, pop punk and melodic hardcore. Chuck was getting heavier opting out the original pop punk sound with strong metal influences and an alternative rock sound, but the band kept in touch with its punk rock and melodic hardcore roots, which created an even more mature side than the group's previous effort. Critics have described Underclass Hero as a revival of the band's pop punk style. Some of the band's songs contain political-social commentary; The Jester is an anti-Bush screed, Underclass Hero is a song about class struggle, and Dear Father is about Deryck's absent father. The band's next effort, Screaming Bloody Murder, marks a return to the direction of Chuck, with songs such as the title track or the Grammy-nominated Blood in my Eyes featuring heavier guitar riffs. Opposite to the heavier direction, there are also tracks such as the second single Baby You Don't Wanna Know whose style leans more towards a garage rock approach.

BBC Music described the song as blisteringly fast, commending Barker's drum work on the song. Thomas Nassiff of AbsolutePunk called the song instantly accessible, noting that, for fans, the song the high-energy pop-punk track we all wanted. Kyle Ryan of The A.V.

Lyrically, the song is a comment on homophobia in certain parts of the music and entertainment industries. Fishel has described the song as both a fun, tongue-in-cheek response to certain A&R guys in major labels and as an anthem of pride in celebration of the LGBTQ community. The song is inspired by Fishel's experiences of the entertainment industry as an out, gay artist and of being repeatedly advised to remove any openly gay content from his work. The lyrics to the first verse of the song talk about the music industry and the second verse refers to Hollywood and the movie business. In an interview with Northern Ireland's GayNI Magazine, Fishel said Radio-Friendly Pop Song is based on my (and many others) experiences of being a gay artist in the entertainment industry, and the latent homophobia that still lies underneath the surface of certain corporate companies.

The opening track, Breakout, is a dance-pop number that begins with a fast beat, composed of chiming electric guitar and drums and later progresses to the snares skip and the keyboards shimmer; ecstatic beats pummel throughout. The song's lyrics are a girls-only call to fun that anecdote on feelings about coming of age and the desire to be school-free. The uptempo refrains of 7 Things are pop punk influenced. The song is a three-tempo patchwork quilt, transitioning from sensitive breakup song in the strummy verses to punky-pop kiss-off in the double-time choruses. 7 Things' lyrics list seven traits Cyrus hates about an ex-boyfriend. The Driveway is a power ballad whose lyrics regard a breakup, insisting nothing hurts like losing when you know it's really gone. The cover of Cyndi Lauper's Girls Just Wanna Have Fun replaces the subtle reggae undercurrent in the original version with a more rock music driven sound that includes pop punk beats and string stabs. The lyrics of Girls Just Wanna Have Fun primarily discuss the desire to let loose with one's friends, touching upon details of the life of an overworked child star. The song Full Circle is composed of a several pop rock hooks; in one of the hooks, Cyrus finishes various words with Oh, oh, oh!.

The most famous Swedish punk band was Ebba Grn, followed KSMB, but other notable bands were Asta Kask, Grisen Skriker, Kriminella Gitarrer, The Pain and   Gteborg Sound. In the 1980s hardcore punk, kngpunk and crust punk became popular in Sweden. The two perhaps most influential bands are Mob 47 and Anti Cimex, whose music has also inspired many foreign bands. Some other examples of influential bands is Moderat Likvidation, Black Uniforms, Totalitr and Avskum. Together with the early American hardcore bands and the British band Discharge, the Swedish punk scene since the early 1990s consisted almost exclusively of tribute bands to the above.

Westfall also said once the band return home from touring, they were going to drop everything and start writing and doing pre-production full time. At this point, the band had ten songs and were trying to condense them into five, then planning to write five more. Westfall said the band completed the final few songs when we were back home with Tom (Denney) and Chad (Gilbert). On the pace of writing, McKinnon said: It seems like a really fast thing that has happened but we've been constantly working on it the entire time.

Described as horror punk, punk rock, pop punk, and melodic hardcore, the album uses elements of heavy metal, hardcore punk, thrash metal, d-beat and, on the song Thanks for Nothing, hip hop. Although the album has been described as pop punk by some sources, Counterculture.co.uk considered it an album that shows Sum 41 abandoning the pop punk genre for a more standard punk rock style.

The philosophy of the album, expounded in the ample liner notes and encapsulated in the song New Noise, was that punk and hardcore music could not be anti-establishment by continuing to package revolutionary lyrics in sounds which had been increasingly co-opted into the mainstream. The sound of the record challenged existing punk sensibilities; it can be seen as punk at a fundamental level and includes experimental combinations of post-hardcore, post-punk, techno, and jazz sounds. The album reveals musical differences to pop punk bands such as Green Day and Blink-182, and also to even more traditional punk rock bands such as Bad Religion and Pennywise.",CAR_1e96e613348f2f2fd865734cbc3ac65541bc8198,1,,

In the late 1970s, UK bands such as Buzzcocks and the Undertones combined pop-style tunes and lyrical themes with punk's speed and chaotic edge. In the early 1980s, some of the leading bands in Southern California's hardcore punk rock scene emphasized a more melodic approach than was typical of their peers. According to music journalist Ben Myers, Bad Religion layered their pissed off, politicized sound with the smoothest of harmonies; Descendents wrote almost surfy, Beach Boysinspired songs about girls and food and being young(ish). Epitaph Records, founded by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion, was the base for many future pop punk bands. Bands that fused punk with light-hearted pop melodies, such as the Queers and Screeching Weasel, began appearing around the country, in turn influencing bands like Green Day and the Offspring, who brought pop punk wide popularity and major record sales. Bands such as the Vandals and Guttermouth developed a style blending pop melodies with humorous and offensive lyrics. Eventually, the geographically large midwest U.S. punk scene, anchored largely in places like Chicago and Minneapolis, would spawn bands like Dillinger Four who would talk a catchy, hooky pop-punk approach and reinfuse it with some of punk's earlier grit and fury, creating a distinctive punk rock sound with a regional tag. This particular substrate still maintains an identity today. The mainstream pop punk of latter-day bands such as Blink-182 is criticized by many punk rock devotees; in critic Christine Di Bella's words, It's punk taken to its most accessible point, a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all, except in the three-chord song structures.",CAR_db3a995f469874a79e713223a2e64ec4e7b35d75,3," Unlike previous albums by the band, Modern makes prominent use of numerous electronic instruments and drum machines, particularly on Steve Diggle's material, although Shelley's songs are more akin to the band's usual catchy, tightly written punk and pop songs. Michael Sandlin of Pitchfork saw it as an attempt from the band to sound current and compared its programmed drums and sputtering synth blips to techno. Shelley said that the band were trying not to make a rock album. So, instead of trying to make it sound like we were a rock band, we tried a more studio based approach. And, more control over what was going on. Also, we felt uncomfortable with trying to be a rock band, when everybody's trying to be one. We though, why bother...be more modern. Ear Candy Mag told him that Modern is contemporary, but it is definitely Buzzcocks, noting that his voice is very distinctive. Antek Gun of Ox Fanzine said that instead of being a punk rock album, Modern sees the band work with strange, rapidly alternating sounds, sizzling guitars, synthesizers from a forgotten time. However, Wilson Neate of Westnet played down the electronic influence of the album, saying that the album continues the pretty much same approach as the band's 1970s albums: short, sharp-edged, anxious and angst ridden, irritable and irritated punk pop.",CAR_e0049c916adeee73f211727383c0e633f994c9c0,3," The Ramones had a broad and lasting influence on the development of popular music.

As described by AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, The band's first four albums set the blueprint for punk, especially American punk and hardcore, for the next two decades. Trouser Presss Robbins and Isler similarly wrote that the Ramones not only spearheaded the original new wavepunk movement, but also drew the blueprint for subsequent hardcore punk bands. Punk journalist Phil Strongman writes, In purely musical terms, the Ramones, in attempting to re-create the excitement of pre-Dolby rock, were to cast a huge shadowthey had fused a blueprint for much of the indie future.

Allmusic's Corey Apar also gave the album a glowing review, writing ...Is a Real Boy comes off as an impressively well-done, multifaceted effort that deserves multiple spins and makes Say Anything truly a band to watch. Punk News noted that the album seems to be commenting in the over-use of irony in the emo scene, writing Yes, this album is highly ironic in that it's critical of the scene it's categorized in and it's an album about a band and there are songs in here that are about songs. But, Bemis's overall quirkiness makes it work. Entertainment Weekly wrote that, Say Anything, an emo act based in L.A., has a new disc that proves that the genre can be artful and intriguing.

The single was officially released worldwide on 18 March 2013. The song is a comment on Fishel's experiences of the entertainment industry and of being repeatedly advised to remove any openly gay content from his work. In an interview with Blair Martin on Brisbane's Queer Radio 4ZZZ in May 2013, Fishel said that the song was a fun, tongue-in-cheek response to certain A&R guys in major labels. The song contains elements of pop, rock and punk and includes an a cappella breakdown section. LGBT entertainment blog The G-List Society called Radio-Friendly Pop Song our favourite track of 2013 and the most buzz-worthy song of Fishel's discography. They wrote of the song: This catchy tune serves as a confrontational truth to mainstream music industrys hesitation to allow same-sex love songs to be promoted to the masses. The lyrics blasting status-quo are genius and the choruses are spot on. We have lived to hear many hit singles pushing the buttons of controversy; yet, we have never heard a delectable tune challenging the seemingly homophobic practices of the music industry. Jeremy Feist of Canadian magazine Xtra! said Radio-Friendly Pop Song was really good and super catchy.

This was previously an explicitly anti-mainstream grouping of genres that rose to great fame beginning in the early 1990s. The genre in its early stages was largely situated on Sub Pop Records, a company founded by Bruce Pavitt and John Poneman. Significant grunge bands signed to the label were Green River (half of the members from this band would later become founding members of Pearl Jam), Sonic Youth (although not a grunge band they were influential on grunge bands and in fact it was upon the insistence of Kim Gordon that the David Geffen Company signed Nirvana) and Nirvana. Grunge is an alternative rock subgenre with a dark, brooding guitar-based sludge sound, drawing on heavy metal, punk, and elements of bands like Sonic Youth and their use of unconventional tunings to bend otherwise standard pop songs completely out of shape. With the addition of a melodic, Beatlesque element to the sound of bands like Nirvana, grunge became wildly popular across the United States. Grunge became commercially successful in the early 1990s, peaking between 1991 and 1994. Bands from cities in the U.S. Pacific Northwest especially Seattle, Washington, were responsible for creating grunge and later made it popular with mainstream audiences. The supposed Generation X, who had just reached adulthood as grunge's popularity peaked, were closely associated with grunge, the sound which helped define the desperation of (that) generation. Later Post Grunge bands such as Foo Fighters and Creed became popular form of Alternative rock because it was and still is very radio friendly unlike the Grunge band of which they were musically influenced by. Pop punk bands like Green Day and Blink 182 also gained popularity. In the second half of the 1990s nu metal arose with bands such as Linkin Park, Korn, Limp Bizkit and Slipknot. The independent culture slumbered in the underground scenes with new genres such as lo-fi (Beck, Sparklehorse, Guided By Voices), math rock (Slint, Shellac) and post-rock (Mogwai, Explosions in the Sky). Emocore and Post-hardcore became more known with bands such as At the Drive-In and Fugazi.",CAR_e5147fbb946d26c6eb49461e6efc463a00bf312b,1," A Short Collection of Short Songs is an EP by Ohio based Pop Punk band Mixtapes (band).

The term jangle pop may be derived from the lyric In the jingle jangle morning, I'll come following you from The Byrds' cover of Bob Dylan's song Mr. Tambourine Man, and the chiming sound of the twelve-string Rickenbacker's upper-register strings. Jangle pop saw a crossover with other subgenres of the 60s and 70s, including power pop artists like Raspberries and Big Star who blurred the line between the two styles, and folk rock artists such as Simon and Garfunkel. The artists that pioneered jangle pop in the 60s and 70s would later become an influence on 1980s post-punk and new wave artists.",CAR_eb8f340fe78f6f3eae15414aa09f02c04342ef47,0," Popular music of the United Kingdom in the 1980s built on the post-punk and new wave movements, incorporating different sources of inspiration from subgenres and what is now classed as world music in the shape of Jamaican and Indian music. It also explored the consequences of new technology and social change in the electronic music of synthpop. In the early years of the decade, while subgenres like heavy metal music continued to develop separately, there was a considerable crossover between rock and more commercial popular music, with a large number of more serious bands, like The Police and UB40, enjoying considerable single chart success. The advent of MTV and cable video helped spur what has been seen as a Second British Invasion in the early years of the decade, with British bands enjoying more success in America than they had since the height of the Beatles' popularity in the 1960s. However, by the end of the decade a fragmentation has been observed, with many new forms of music and sub-cultures, including Hip Hop and House music, while the single charts were once again dominated by pop artists, now often associated with the Hi-NRG hit factory of Stock Aitken Waterman. The rise of the Indie rock scene was partly a response to this, and marked a shift away from the major music labels and towards the importance of local scenes like Madchester and subgenres, like gothic rock.",CAR_edc3aecaa4534e095d7c2ac8585670d65014133c,0,,

Eventually the band created a hybrid sound for the song, mixing guitar-based rock and electronica. The process of creating a guitar-based rock song reminded Kusakari of her teenager years before joining Sakanaction, when she performed in rock and punk bands in Sapporo. One of the techniques used by the band to make the song more pop was to increase the tempo to 138 BPM. Yamaguchi initially felt embarrassed that the band were able to create such a pop song, however after the song's release found that the band's audience responded well to the style, the band integrated the pop style found on Sen to Rei into the band's music, eventually becoming a central part of Sakanaction's musical identity.",CAR_efa8986c9248012e364fcf5dcf9afb0cb332570b,0," Covers of the song in a punk style include a thrash parody version by British punk rock band Snuff for their 1998 EP, Schminkie Minkie Pinkie, a punk rock version by Dutch band Heideroosjes for their 1999 album, Schizo, and a pop punk cover by Zebrahead for their 2004 EP, Waste of MFZB.

Its musical direction is generally popR&B orientated and has been described by Stump as soul punk and smart pop, drawing influence from a wide scope of artists including Prince, Michael Jackson and David Bowie. According to Stump, the song changed the entire course of Soul Punk. I had written a while draft of the album and then at the 11th hour came up with This City, I really loved the song but felt like, conceptually, it didn't fit on the album. I had to go back and make an album for that song because I loved it so much. So one of the holdups on the album was re-writing the record around it. With Soul Punk originally due in February 2011, Stump delayed it to October 18 and rebuilt the album with the song, releasing Truant Wave EP in the meanwhile for its delay in February 2011.

AllMusic reviewer William Ruhlmann opened his review with mentioning how the group released several releases in the preceding 18 months. Calling this decision indicative of Man Overboard's youthful drive; this is a band that is in a hurry. This rush was expressed in the breakneck tempos of the short (none over three and a half minutes) songs on the group's self-titled album. Ruhlmann classified the album's sound as being standard-issue pop punk in the vein of Green Day and Blink-182, with an echo of Jimmy Eat World, in terms of the contrasting vocals of Bruzzese and Eisenstein. Kaj Roth of Melodic noted that how Man Overboard's name was taken from the Blink-182 song of the same name, it makes sense when I listen to their new album which is a major flirt with B812's early sound. He went on further to say this is pop punk how it sounded back around 1999-2002 with faster songs and more focus on punk rock than pop. Roth closed with calling the release a solid album.

The fusion of emo with pop punk is also known as emo pop. According to AllMusic, some emo leans toward the progressive side, full of complex guitar work, unorthodox song structures, arty noise, and extreme dynamic shifts; some emo is much closer to punk-pop, though it's a bit more intricate. Lyrics, which are a key focus in the genre, are typically emotional and often personal, dealing with topics such as failed romance; AllMusic described emo lyrics as usually either free-associative poetry or intimate confessionals. According to AllMusic, early emo bands were hardcore bands that favored expressive vocals over the typical barking rants of regular hardcore and most 1990s emo bands borrowed from some combination of Fugazi, Sunny Day Real Estate, and Weezer. The New York Times described as emo as emotional punk or post-hardcore or pop-punk. That is, punk that wears its heart on its sleeve and tries a little tenderness to leaven its sonic attack.

Dave Beech of Clash noted that these groups were darker and more mature than those previously, taking  influence and occasional indifference from 1990s emo. On The Wonder Years' The Upsides (2010), vocalist Dan Campbell sung about His early twenties soul-searching and tales of strife which resonated with a new generation, inspiring countless imitators in the process. This pushed Campbell to the forefront of a new wave, and the album influencing a new wave of pop punk bands.

But we are really good friends with all of those bands. Theyre like brothers to us and I think, in that way, it is a collective. A self-defined movement which The Guardian described in their article The A-Z of pop in 2012 as having heavy lyrical emphasis and are reminiscent of the 90s emo scene.

The glossy production instantly set Blink-182 apart from the other crossover punk acts, such as Green Day. Scott Russo of Unwritten Law remarked that he would receive CDs from fans that mimicked the pop punk sound the album made famous. It was revolutionary, it was equally as revolutionary as Green Day when it hit, they just didn't get the credit, Russo remarked in 2009. Matt Diehl, author of My So-Called Punk, writes that mainstream acolytes of their sound led to profound effects on the pop punk genre, such as the deracination of regional scene identitydue to its wide popularity, pop punk bands became commonplace outside its origins. Jon Blisten of Beats Per Minute writes that Enema success perpetuated pop-punks viability on mainstream radio, which is where Blinks progeny  bands like Fall Out Boy, Simple Plan, and New Found Glory  would receive a decent amount of airplay.

Joe DeAndrea from Absolute Punk said that Jet Lag is Simple Plan's first big single in a long time, almost in vein of No Pads' I'd Do Anything. Not as rocking, but packs the same similar punch. Davey Boy from Sputnikmusic was also positive, saying that English pop songstress Natasha Bedingfield fares best with the call and response vocals of 'Jet Lag' making for an effective radio pop-rocker that plies the oft-used theme of long-distance relationships.",CAR_5e0d42fb25926224dbb6e0262380a7ad37f42d63,0," Emo Urbanism is another philosophy critical of Landscape Urbanism. The movement contends that Landscape Urbanism views ecology as an aesthetic element of style and not urban ecology. The artificial ecology replaces the entropic state to re-create a landscape that fits a particular brand or aesthetic. The loss is a dynamic, adaptive, and certainly essential urban system. Emo urbanism differs by making evolving nature a key component of the design process. The realization of this process is called Urbanature and Big Nature. As an evolving urban ecology, Charles Morris Anderson has described this connection as the thinness. It is the simultaneous perception and implicit understanding of the past, present, and future. Emo Urbanist projects include the built work of Charles Anderson at the Olympic Sculpture Park  in Seattle, WA; The Anchorage Museum Common in Anchorage, AK; the yet to be constructed Project Phoenix  in Haiti and Hellinikon's Metropolitan Park  in Athens, Greece.",CAR_5e9cbae1095cb57716505c2842573b9e52b842a8,0," A label given to one subculture andor its fashions can also be subverted into an entirely different meaning once the style associated with the group evolves in the hand of mainstream stores and consumers. For example, in a 2003 review of the book Nothing Feels Good: Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo, Mike Tribby of Booklist writes the major commercial music purveyors pay scant attention to the youngsters buying hundreds of thousands of copies of albums by emo bands... even though the rest of the music industry is in the doldrums. Those bands create a sort of personal music...they aren't boy bands and Britney Spears knockoffs...their music... combines the thoughtfulness of folk with the sensibilities and DIY ethos of punk. Emo bands appeal with introspective lyrics rather than the see my clothes, see my butt treacle major labels promote. Sailing under the hype radar, emo is the current manifestation of music that is perfect for the young; that is, unknown and inaccessible to adults. He goes on to call the book A valuable resource for young listeners and adults and to get it before emo goes the corporate way of alternative rock. A few years later the term emo was being applied to a very different type of cultural group with a style that is highly visible on Mtv and other youth-centered media and widely marketed in chain stores of all ilks, hardly the ignored, underground, genre it was known as in '03. Tibby himself, in another Booklist review of the book Everybody Hurts: An Essential Guide to Emo Culture states Self-centered, whiny songs and introspective posing have been part of rock from the beginning...but with emo they are the center of a packaged subculture. This is an instance of the cycle of subculture that is common to almost any niche group, and thus to any form of alternative fashion. From punk and goth to raver and grunge styles, the same pattern is seen again and again - a tiny group forms and is recognized for their uniqueness, the style grows in popularity to the point of being noticed by mainstream media and fashion, said style is then mass marketed and eventually joins the ranks of cliche.",CAR_602b45590d9071754577c3035d61b944229ef244,0," As emo became more successful in the mid-1990s due to the rise of grunge, emo pop was set as blueprints by bands such as The Wrens, which pioneered a form of emo-pop on 1996's Secaucus, and Weezer, which in 1996 released the definitive emo album Pinkerton. Other bands which put out releases in the 90s to set up the blueprints for emo pop included Sense Field, Jejune, Alkaline Trio and The Get Up Kids. As emo became commercially successful in the early 2000s, the emo pop movement was birthed by Jimmy Eat World's 2001 release Bleed American and the success of that album's single The Middle. Bands like Weezer and The Wrens both saw great success in this new movement, the former with its release The Green Album and the latter with Meadowlands, which reinvented punk-pop for the new generation.",CAR_606c4e39f275b6eabdd2815b01bb0696ac731df4,1,,

Many commentators stated that the band's polished pop sound only remotely resembled punk music. Although the video for All the Small Things was filmed as a mockery of boy bands and teen pop, fame didn't discriminate based on origin: soon the group was as famous as those it was parodying. Blink now had the backing of a major record company ... just like the synthesized pop acts they were spoofing, said British journalist Tim Footman. In what way were they less 'pop' than Sugar Ray and 98 Degrees? Matt Diehl, author of the book My So-Called Punk, called the basis for satire thin: To seasoned ears, Blink-182 sounded and looked just as manufactured as the pop idols they were poking fun at. The band faced a backlash shortly after Enema of the State was released from several punk and emo acts who wished to not be associated with their music. Tristin Laughter, employee of Bay Area record label Lookout! Records, wrote in an issue of the influential zine Punk Planet that the band would have a genuinely negative impact on punk and accused the band of misogyny. DeLonge responded to the accusations, commenting, I love all those criticisms, because fuck all those magazines! I hate with a passion Maximumrocknroll and all those zines that think they know what punk is supposed to be. I think it's so much more punk to piss people off than to conform to all those veganistic views. While ska veterans Blue Meanies tried to empathize (I think they Blink are just trying to get in the mindset of a teenager, which means a lot of curiosity about sex,) others, such as John Lydon, frontman of the Sex Pistols and Public Image Ltd, dismissed the band as a bunch of silly boys ... an imitation of a comedy act.",CAR_6a9308cf9b6db449da3c8aeaeb550510ca83750d,0," Among other groups he is a long-term member of Curtis, which he co-founded in 1994 as a melodic rock and punk band. Meier plays guitar and piano, Lennie Haggerty is on drums, Mike Chhangur is on bass, and all members contribute vocals and songwriting. Their first album, Curtis, was released in May 1997, with mixing, engineering, and mastering by Meier. Wrote Entertainment LA, the 14-song release is full of catchy upbeat instrumentals with the occasional anthemic power-pop undertone, but the band never fails to maintain their punk edge... The way Meier delivers Curtis's often confessional and esoteric lyrics with the perfect blend of that melancholic emo whine and pop-punk optimism that's so memorable of 90s underground emo punk solidified their place next to American bands like Jawbreaker, Knapsack and Sunny Day Real Estate.",CAR_6f23dfb7a864731a9f94302ff98be3ad8219fcfa,0," The origins of 1990s punk pop can be seen in the more song-oriented bands of the 1970s punk movement like The Buzzcocks and The Clash, commercially successful new wave acts such as The Jam and The Undertones, and the more hardcore-influenced elements of alternative rock in the 1980s. Pop-punk tends to use power-pop melodies and chord changes with speedy punk tempos and loud guitars. Punk music provided the inspiration for some California-based bands on independent labels in the early 1990s, including Rancid, Pennywise, Weezer and Green Day. In 1994 Green Day moved to a major label and produced the album Dookie, which found a new, largely teenage, audience and proved a surprise diamond-selling success, leading to a series of hit singles, including two number ones in the US. They were soon followed by the eponymous dbut from Weezer, which spawned three top ten singles in the US. This success opened the door for the multi-platinum sales of metallic punk band The Offspring with Smash (1994). This first wave of pop punk reached its commercial peak with Green Day's Nimrod (1997) and The Offspring's Americana (1998).",CAR_70ac76757b782dc11f0c363fa94a0864a417d37f,0," The band's musical style is widely recognizable by its unique blend of pop punk with the Moog synthesizer. The usage of the Moog stems from Cain, who first heard the instrument employed on the Rentals' album Return of the Rentals (1995). He subsequently bought a cheap Moog at a pawn shop and wanted it to be an integral part of Motion City upon their formation. Johnson became known for his signature Moogstand in live performances, which consisted of a handstand on the instrument. The group has been widely attributed to a number of different genres, including pop rock, indie rock, emo, and pop punk.

I Stay in Love was released as the fourth and final single from the album, and places fourth on its track-listing. Written by Carey and Bryan-Michael Cox, is a mid-tempo beat-driven and piano-laced ballad, that is influenced by pop and R&B music genres. The song's instrumentation is derived from a piano melody, and is backed by a strong computerized drum-beat. Its lyrics find Carey as her most vulnerable; she describes old times she shared with her lover, and that even though we said let go, and inside she knows its over, she still stays in love with him. Featuring American rapper Young Jeezy, Side Effects describes Carey's abusive relationship with Tommy Mottola, her ex-husband. During the first verse, she discusses the pair's background, and how she was young and naive, and believed everything he preached to her. The lyrics read Keepin' me there, under your thumb  Cause you were scared that I'd become much  More than you could handle, she confesses, and refers to herself as Shining like a chandelier  That decorated every room inside  The private hell we built  And I dealt with it  Like a kid I wished  I could fly away. According to Freedom De Luc of The Washington Post, on the song Carey uploads on Mottola, 'sleeping with the enemy, aware that he was smothering every last part of me.' She finally walked away, she sings, 'but I still live with the side effects.' Sarah Rodman from The Boston Globe described it as another look at her fractious marriage to Mottola, and wrote Although the union ended in 1998, Carey is still suffering, including dreams of the 'violent times' and 'sleeping with the enemy'. Interestingly, her vocal approach here is almost emo, as she hits her rock-solid middle register and refuses to be held captive by the demons of her past.

On The Wonder Years' The Upsides (2010), vocalist Dan Campbell sung about His early twenties soul-searching and tales of strife which resonated with a new generation, inspiring countless imitators in the process. This pushed Campbell to the forefront of a new wave, and the album influencing a new wave of pop punk bands. The Story So Far's second album, What You Don't See (2013), cemented their place at the top table of nu pop-punk. Rock Sound included The Wonder Years' The Greatest Generation on their best albums of 2013 list, calling it the defining album of what may well have been the genre's best year for a decade. Kerrang! said the album ripped up the pop-punk blueprint pushing the genre to new peaks of invention, both lyrically and musically.

Andrew Kelham opined that, each song is a thick cut of pop punk played to perfection by a group of musicians who have taken a genre by the throat and defined it with their sound. The A.V Club critic Aaron Burgess awarded the album a B grade and remarked; the loud-guitar and crunching-rhythm style that drives the album, demonstrates that, softening middle years be damned, New Found Glory still hits hard enough to matter. Adam Webb, staff writer for Ultimate-Guitar was also largely favourable in his review, awarding a score of 8.310. He commented that the band had, created a rockin' pop punk album that shows just why they stand so tall above the crowd of uneventful scenesters that is the tragedy of the music scene today. Hailing the band as the undisputed kings of pop punk, he finalised his review by adding, You'd be clinically insane not to give this album a go. Either that or you're blind, deaf and dumb. In which case you have a valid reason and a much bigger problem at hand. However, other reviews were less receptive. Tom Bryant of British magazine Kerrang! was critical of the album's sound; Their major label record deal came to a conclusion and they scurried back to the sort of independent punk label on which they first made their name. Next, they ask blink-182's Mark Hoppus to produce, a man who, intermittenty, is in the band to who NFG once aspired to be. It all begs the question as to whether this is a sound of a brand trying to recapture the past; a band having a midlife crisis. In his review for Rocklouder!, critic John Webber noted that By no means is this a bad record; in fact it easily lays waste to most releases in the same vain this side of Coming Home, but when held up against such a stunning back catalogue, it is certainly not an essential purchase for any new fans. PopMatters echoed this sentiment by writing, It doesnt mean theyve made a bad album here, just a predictable one.

This is most easily seen, due to the fact that Orlando has been a breeding ground for rock music. The culture progressed as time went on, starting in 1995 from when alternative-rock band Matchbox Twenty, and pop-rock bands NSync and Backstreet Boys originated. Over the years, the intensity of the music increased. In the late 1990s, Skrape, a metal band, was established, shortly followed by the screamo band From First to Last as well as the alternative metal band Fireflight. In the early 2000s, the heavy metal bands Trivium and Alter Bridge formed. In the later 2000s, more screamo bands, such as Blood on the Dance Floor (duo), Sleeping with Sirens, and Broadway (band) were established.

By the mid-1980s, several bands merged hardcore punk with pop music to create a new, faster pop punk sound such as Dag Nasty, the Nip Drivers, T.S.O.L., Social Distortion, and the Descendents. Pop punk in the United States began to grow in popularity locally in California in the mid to late 1980s. Pop punk particularly thrived in California, where independent record labels adopted a do it yourself (DIY) approach to releasing music. By the mid 1990s, a few pop punk bands had started to sell millions of records and receive extensive radio and television airplay, such as Green Day. By 1994, pop punk was quickly growing in mainstream popularity. The late 1990s, exemplified by the 1999 release of Blink-182's Enema of the State, represented the genre's mainstream peak, although some pop punk bands scored successful album chartings in the 2000s.

Todd Martens of Billboard described M.I.A. on the song as a revolutionary leading a class war. Writing for NME, Alex Miller commented that Paper Planes was Kalas only real pop moment ... but that it sabotages any FM potential by crafting its infectious chorus around four crystal clear gunshots. Describing the song as soft, soaring, he added that the song's The Clash sample was the clearest indication of where M.I.A. sees herself, as the inheritor of true rebel music in an era of corporate punks. Jon Pareles of Blender joked that by M.I.A. standards Paper Planes is almost a ballad, naming it a highlight of Kala. Bill Lamb of About.com claimed it served as a reaffirmation of popular music, deeming it one of the most bracing pop hits in recent history and that the song's patchwork world beat style expands the boundaries of current hit pop music. Joey Guerra of Houston Chronicle described the song's impact alongside the rest of the album, saying Even amid so much rocket-fueled noise, standout Paper Planes causes its own commotion. Citing her lyric where she declares Catch me at the border I got visas in my name, he further added that with music this vital, America should immediately extend an open-door policy to the globe-trotting MC's stunning international flow. Fraser McAlpine, writing for BBC Radio 1 compared the artist's vocals favorably to those of Boyz, describing them as icy and distant in the verse, giving way to a catchy, juvenile playground chant that made both songs earworms. McAlpine noted that the power of the song lay in the discordance between the melody of the singing in the verses and the backing, saying there's something very calm and serene about the music, and the slight mismatch in tone with the melody slaps you around the ears, demanding your attention, and forcing you to listen to the words. And when you do, and realise it's a dead-eyed skit on ruthless business practices, it just multiplies the queasy power of the song.

Alternative Press gave the album 3.55. Commenting on the album's first single, they said 'Weightless' is an insta-classic. The reviewer, however, was disappointed in the producers for their use of Auto-Tune, saying This boy (Gaskarth) can sing, let him already. The article also contradicted AbsolutePunk's view on the song Too Much, saying it is a remarkable progression for the quartet: a slow, electronic-tinged number. The Washington Post was also hugely favorable of the album. Reviewer Nancy Dunham said The songs on Nothing Personal are what pop-punk is all about -- or should be, anyway. She also said the album will likely gain the band plenty of media and popular attention and that the album's 12 tunes are so jaunty and their lyrics about first love, betrayal and parties so angst-filled you can easily imagine them playing in the background of the TV shows The Hills or 90210. Tim Sendra of Allmusic awarded a score of 3.55. Although he stated All Time Low shows signs of maturing, he summarised by adding, Nothing Personal is an example of emo-pop at its best, and anyone who thinks emo is just a bunch of pop junk might be surprised at how catchy and powerful a modern rock album it is. Kerrang! writer Nick Ruskell, rated the album with KKKK's (45) and praised lead single, Weightless, as a three minute rush of punk smothered in pop fairy dust. He went on to add that, Nothing Personal is simply a good, fun record. Rock Sound stated the band had nailed it with their third offering awarding a score of 810. The review went on to say, Lead single Weightless kicks things off in cracking fashion with its epic sing-along chorus, and the momentum continues well into the rest of the album. Matt Squire (Panic! at the Disco) returns with his trademark production polish. Courtney Lear of online music site ShockHound, also praised the album awarding a score of 55.

In the late 1970s, UK bands such as Buzzcocks and the Undertones combined pop-style tunes and lyrical themes with punk's speed and chaotic edge. In the early 1980s, some of the leading bands in Southern California's hardcore punk rock scene emphasized a more melodic approach than was typical of their peers. According to music journalist Ben Myers, Bad Religion layered their pissed off, politicized sound with the smoothest of harmonies; Descendents wrote almost surfy, Beach Boysinspired songs about girls and food and being young(ish). Epitaph Records, founded by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion, was the base for many future pop punk bands. Bands that fused punk with light-hearted pop melodies, such as the Queers and Screeching Weasel, began appearing around the country, in turn influencing bands like Green Day and the Offspring, who brought pop punk wide popularity and major record sales. Bands such as the Vandals and Guttermouth developed a style blending pop melodies with humorous and offensive lyrics. Eventually, the geographically large midwest U.S. punk scene, anchored largely in places like Chicago and Minneapolis, would spawn bands like Dillinger Four who would talk a catchy, hooky pop-punk approach and reinfuse it with some of punk's earlier grit and fury, creating a distinctive punk rock sound with a regional tag. This particular substrate still maintains an identity today. The mainstream pop punk of latter-day bands such as Blink-182 is criticized by many punk rock devotees; in critic Christine Di Bella's words, It's punk taken to its most accessible point, a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all, except in the three-chord song structures.",CAR_db3a995f469874a79e713223a2e64ec4e7b35d75,0," The styles of rock bands from the Dominican Republic differ greatly.

Michael Sandlin of Pitchfork saw it as an attempt from the band to sound current and compared its programmed drums and sputtering synth blips to techno. Shelley said that the band were trying not to make a rock album. So, instead of trying to make it sound like we were a rock band, we tried a more studio based approach. And, more control over what was going on. Also, we felt uncomfortable with trying to be a rock band, when everybody's trying to be one. We though, why bother...be more modern. Ear Candy Mag told him that Modern is contemporary, but it is definitely Buzzcocks, noting that his voice is very distinctive. Antek Gun of Ox Fanzine said that instead of being a punk rock album, Modern sees the band work with strange, rapidly alternating sounds, sizzling guitars, synthesizers from a forgotten time. However, Wilson Neate of Westnet played down the electronic influence of the album, saying that the album continues the pretty much same approach as the band's 1970s albums: short, sharp-edged, anxious and angst ridden, irritable and irritated punk pop.",CAR_e0049c916adeee73f211727383c0e633f994c9c0,0," The band chose to tune the all their guitars down half a step to help with the change.

Released before emo had become a dirty word, the disc boasted a boisterous but sensitive pop-punk mood that was reflected on its cover - perfectly encapsulating the record's lyrical and sonic dance between teenage romantic naivet and adulthood. PopMatters writer Melissa Bobbit, whilst reviewing a show on the anniversary tour, enthused what a blessing it is to still have NFG around, on this, the 10th anniversary of their self-titled record. This tour served as a collection of whimsical snapshots in their prolific career. New Found Glorys influence is vastly felt today. A testament to that was supporting act Fireworks, whose whiplash sound and choreographed jumping all came from the pages of the NFG guidebook to punk-pop. Jason Tate, the founder and CEO of AbsolutePunk, wrote of the album, Back when New Found Glory's Self-Titled album was released there weren't many that gave it a chance to be one of the building-blocks for an entire genre. However, in hindsight, it appears as though that disc may have had more of an impact than anyone ever could have guessed. Mark Hoppus, who later produced the band's sixth studio album, said of New Found Glory: It was one of those records that never found its way out of my CD player. New Found Glory just had something different and unique. I was really drawn to their melodies, and their guitar parts were more interesting and more creative than a lot of the stuff that was going on. It was also explained that when Jared Logan was producing Fall Out Boy's debut album, he asked bassist Pete Wentz about the sound the band had desired for recording. Wentz responded by handing over the first two New Found Glory records.

AbsolutePunk.net reviewer Jason Tate awarded the album a 99% rating and praised the band's writing, saying By the second song it is perceptible that the band has a grasp on crafting songs that do not follow a formula, or insult the listener by maintaining a hold on one particular style or sound. Allmusic's Corey Apar also gave the album a glowing review, writing ...Is a Real Boy comes off as an impressively well-done, multifaceted effort that deserves multiple spins and makes Say Anything truly a band to watch. Punk News noted that the album seems to be commenting in the over-use of irony in the emo scene, writing Yes, this album is highly ironic in that it's critical of the scene it's categorized in and it's an album about a band and there are songs in here that are about songs. But, Bemis's overall quirkiness makes it work. Entertainment Weekly wrote that, Say Anything, an emo act based in L.A., has a new disc that proves that the genre can be artful and intriguing.

When interviewed for a retrospective article in Alternative Press at the time The Get Up Kids disbanded in 2005, Pete Wentz stated that Fall Out Boy would not be a band if it were not for The Get Up Kids. Early in the band's career, when Jared Logan was producing the group's debut album, he asked bassist Pete Wentz what sound the band desired for recording. Wentz responded by handing over the first two New Found Glory records. Wentz also cites Green Day, the Ramones, Screeching Weasel, Metallica, Earth Crisis, Gorilla Biscuits and Lifetime as influences. The band acknowledges its hardcore punk roots as an influence; all four members were involved in the Chicago hardcore scene before joining Fall Out Boy. Wentz described the band's affiliation with the genre by saying I think the interesting thing is that we are all hardcore kids that are writing pop music...It gives us a different style because at our core we are always hardcore.
