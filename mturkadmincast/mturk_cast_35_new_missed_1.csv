Historically, sanitation has been a concern from the earliest stages of human settlements. The Indus Valley Civilization is particularly notable for its extensive sanitation works, including private flush toilets. For the most part, early cities emptied their waste into rivers or seas manually or via open ditches. Sanitation in ancient Rome was notably advanced, as were some of the reredorters of medieval monasteries, but emptying of chamber pots into city streets continued into the modern era. A precursor to the modern flush toilet system was designed by John Harington in 1596 but did not become common until the late 19th century. Even London, at that time the world's largest city, did not require indoor toilets in its building codes until after the First World War.","CAR_07142d6ac6d1dd0ecec4cd00c956b9bc5cf66c78","0"," The early 20th century saw a consolidation of the Memon community in South Asia as well as South Africa.

The partition of Pakistan and India led to significant migration in both directions for the community. During middle of the twentieth century a handful of Memon financial dynasties were born. However, the dynastic wealth of the Memon families stagnated during the late twentieth century due to the partition of Pakistan as well as political turmoil of the country.","CAR_072078611e7ef1af45945dd73e11a6a425fc7fdd","0"," Original station facilities include: ladies' waiting room and powder room; general waiting room; gentlemen's toilets; and a refreshment roomcafe.
