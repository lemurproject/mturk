The book itself was dedicated to the Duchess, with an image of her as the frontispiece. The Duchess was involved in the breeding of several different dog breeds, including Borzois, Fox Terriers (both Smooth and Wire), Whippets, Scottish Deerhounds and Clumber Spaniels; the breed named after the ancestral home of the Dukes of Newcastle. She was a well-known conformation show judge of the breeds she was involved with.",CAR_03bb8b5381627163a59140fed582b0df07734f13,0," The Australian Terrier is a small breed of dog of the terrier dog type.

In UKC a dog must receive 100 points with at least three competition wins under three different judges.  A competition win is when a dog defeats at least one other dog and receives points. A UKC Grand Champion (GRCh) title is earned by winning in competition with other champions of the breed in at least five shows under at least three different judges.",CAR_136c336c45adeeeffca34719f9bb8f94ff2b451e,0," Rich Rock Priske (born August 29, 1967) is a Canadian musician born in Vancouver, British Columbia. He has long been active in the BC music scene, and has played bass andor written songs for Art Bergmann, DSK, ShoCore, Chrome Dog, Bif Naked and Real McKenzies, and others. Priske is most widely known for playing bass guitar and keyboards in the Canadian band Matthew Good Band.  After the band's dissolution in 2002, he kept playing with Matthew Good until the end of the In a Coma tour in the Fall of 2005. Rich is one of the subjects of the Real McKenzies biography written by Chris Walter (GFY Press).",CAR_1c569ec61cf95d85555c12f09643c4750066420d,0," Later in his career, Coren shifted to the study of canine behavior and the relationship that people have with their dogs. This shift away from neuropsychological research also marked a shift in his publishing strategy, away from single study publications in research journals, to publication of his new data as part of material presented in book form. Many of his books on dogs do contain hithertofore unpublished empirical data. For example, his book The Intelligence of Dogs is based on a survey sent to all of the dog obedience judges in the United States and Canada, and resulted in the ranking of 110 dog breeds by intelligence. This ranking caused a rather large media stir. His book Why we love the dogs we do looks at the personality of people and how the owner's personality predicts their relationship with various dog breeds. It is based on a survey of more than 6000 people who took a personality test and reported on their experiences with the various dogs that they have owned. This book proved to be very popular and Coren's personality test is now used by some dog shelters to determine whether prospective owners are suitable for a particular breed of dog. Similarly, his book Why does my dog act that way? uses data from approximately a thousand dogs to determine features of the personality of various dog breeds. However other books that he has written on dog behavior have provided less formal data presentation and in these his creative contribution is based on the organization and interpretation of the research of others, as is the case in How to speak dog. These books have also been well accepted and have been proven to be very popular.Overall, it is probably true that for scientific audiences Coren is best known for his neuropsychological contributions while for the general public he is best known for his writing and research concerning dogs, dog behavior, and the relationship between dogs and people.",CAR_1d9404ba9ade6b0d016b3c4b50943da4d0b9d12a,0,,

It is believed the Ibizan Hound evolves from the tesem, the ancient Egyptian hunting dog. Representations of this dog on the walls of ancient tombs show a striking similarity to the modern Ibizan Hound. These dogs would have been brought to the island of Eivissa by the Phoenicians, who founded settlements there as early as the 8th century BC. A recent DNA analysis did not find support for this opinion and did not include the Ibizan Hound among their identified ancient dog breeds. A more recent article argues that continued trait selective breeding may be behind this lack of support. Heidi G. Parker, the lead author of the original study has stated recently that indeed their original findings do not imply that the Ibizan Hound is not an ancient breed and that with better tools they would in all likelihood be able to trace a continuous lineage of thousands of years for many dog breeds and add them to their group of ancient dogs.",CAR_2a0ca814e3643c9ffdfaeb6b5f02f11e889c7db4,0,,

Winners Dog and Bitch are judged against all entered champions for Best of Breed. During this competition, Best of Winners (the better of Winners Dog or Winners Bitch) is chosen, as well as Best Opposite Sex (the best dog of the sex opposite to the Best of Breed).",CAR_2a8365486952082fca0d42fa85f2ee44450712f1,0," This ancient extinct breed of dog is commonly considered to be the ancestor (in rivalry with the Alaunt, the dog of the Alans) of today's Mastiff-type dogs and of many other modern breeds. Mastiff-type dogs are often referred to as Molossus dogs or Molossers. It is one of the best-known breeds of Greco-Roman antiquity; however, its physical characteristics and function are debated. Though the Molossus breed no longer exists in its original form, this large ancient breed was, along with the Tibetan Mastiff, an important ancestor of modern breeds such as the English Mastiff, St. Bernard, Great Pyrenees, Rottweiler, Great Dane, Newfoundland, Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, and Bernese Mountain Dog.",CAR_2b2f4096033e02f3be9a628fdc75527b9bd25ae3,0," The Serbian Hound is a very kind breed of dog, forming bonds with its family and owners.

The breed with the next-highest number of attributed fatalities was the Rottweiler and mixes thereof, with 44 fatalities. Given many media sources incorrectly reported that this study suggested that pit bull-type dogs and Rottweilers are disproportionately more dangerous than other dog breeds, the American Veterinary Medical Association whose journal published the original article released a statement detailing that this study cannot be used to infer any breed specific risk for dog bite fatalities. . These figures reporting certain breeds as being more prone to biting has found those to be the breeds in the greatest population where the dog bites are reported.

After fulfilling this, dogs become balanced and well-mannered. Obedience school is often a good start to creating interactive play using words or commands for a dog to perform specific actions on cue.  Teaching a Cairn terrier tricks is also a clever way to direct their active energy into acceptable controlled dog games.",CAR_32e8d09cfe810b043c6e1bee0a651524e79538d8,0,,
3,45_1,45,1," <span>What dog breed is the best for playing?</span>",HIT number 4 of 44 for question 1,false," This is a versatile dog with excellent sense of smell, hearing and vision, strong hunting drive, endurance; they are aggressive to predators and soft and gentle to humans. They are multi-purpose, have got excellent sense of smell, absolute pitch and good eyesight. They are tireless and with good anger towards predators. At the same time, theyve got kind character and are very faithful to people. Yakutian Laikas are not demanding to conditions of life and easily endure the hostile climate of northern Siberia. In harsh Siberian conditions they reveal their stamina; they tend to work in small groups and can work through the whole day, from dawn to sunset. Popularity of dog sledding appeared with the arrival of Russian traders to the Arctic. With the increased demand for white polar foxes in the 17th century, the Arctic exploration received its spike. Furs and mammoth tusks trade became local nations main income. Origin and subsequent formation of the breed are still not quite known, but because of the hard to access country and extreme natural conditions, Yakutian Laikas have lived as primitive aboriginal breeds; they were rarely confined and mated free. Naturally, local type dogs could be preserved only under conditions of complete isolation from dogs of other breeds. First scientific descriptions of dogs of Yakutia were published in late 18th century, when first geographic studies of the north were conducted. Prince Shirinsky-Shikhmatov wrote in his monograph about Laikas: Researchers of the north, of course, could not overlook northern dog; they could not disagree with hard fact that presence of this dog makes life of northern people possible. It is even more strange that so little attention was paid to description of dogs of the north; their ancestral aboriginal type and numerous varieties remain obscure. There are as many types of Laikas as ethnic minorities of the north; varieties of Laikas differ clearly from each other, each has its own peculiarities and their division is indisputable. This monograph was written in 1898. Russian Geographic Society gave task to Mr. Maak to investigate Vilyuisk District. Review of Vilyuiks District of Yakutian Provionce was published in 1877. Maak wrote: I saw dog of very typical appearance and very common in Siberia, which was fox-like. In 1896, V. L. Seroshevsky published a book Yakuts, edited by N. I. Veselovsky. Describing dogs of Yakuts, Seroshevsky divides them into two groups, 1) guarding and hunting dogs and 2) maritime sled dogs. He wrote: even most poor Yakut having no other animals, has at least one dog. Yokhelson (Johelson?), 1898, in his publication Hunting Industry in Kolyma Territory of Yakutian Province and described the Tungus Lajka used for sledding and hunting dogs. He wrote: There are two breeds of dogs, one is so-called Tungus Laika, a pointed-eared dog of nomadic reindeer herders and polar sled dog. All researchers described dogs of Yakutia as one breed of polar sled dogs. Yokhelson wrote: Sled dog is a burden animal not only of nomads living in not forested country, but also of settled near the river Russians and russified minorities and the dog of majority of cattle keeping Yakuts. Except southwestern part of the territory, one can find 5-6 dogs in every yurta, which are used for hauling firewood and other works needed by the household. The polar dog is not big, 50-60 cm at the shoulder In the appearance, with his prick ears, oblique set eyes, thick coat and broad massive head, pointed muzzle, low carried tail (when the dog is tired, eats or in a bad mood), the dog is very similar to wolf. Among them, there are shaggy dogs, and somewhat blunt muzzle not different from our Spitzes  Generally, type of Kolyma sled dog is diverse and, perhaps, it is a mix between Kamchatka and Eskimo sled dogs with another imported breed. It stands to a reason that other dogs relocated here together with new immigrants. Both Seroshevsky and Yokhelson described the Yakutian Sled Dog similarly: Legs relatively thick and short, chest, which is used to pull sleds, perfectly developed; neck is thick and short. Face is unusually intelligent and with melancholic or grim expression. In principle, it remains so today and the dogs little changed with the spreading civilization in the Yakutian north.",CAR_3542fa20c51ca2de096a71df6a466960f665c6a9,0,"  (a type of dog, not an actual species), found what he believed were some examples of similar dogs in the Austrian countryside. In 1921 he began serious breeding to revive and define the type of the breed, to separate them from other landrace pinschers of the area. The Austrian Kennel Club (sterreicher Kynologenverband) first recognised the breed as the sterreichischer Kurzhaarpinscher (translates in English as Austrian Shorthaired Pinscher) in 1928. The name was given to the breed to identify its place of origin as Austria (sterreich), and to differentiate it from the Schnauzer which at that time was called the Rough-haired Pinscher (rauhaariger Pinscher). After World War II, though, the breed almost vanished. In the 1970s only one registered dog of the breed remained, named Diokles of Angern. Breeding this dog with other dogs identified as of the old pinscher type in the area (Landpinschern) has brought the breed back, although there are still only a small number of them.",CAR_36fa0b912516e6159829b6da668ac4a21ab8c4d9,0," The chizer mixes the highly active personality of a miniature schnauzer with the big, bold attitude of a Chihuahua, making them sturdy and seemingly tough dogs. However, the chizer is a fiercely loyal companion to its owner, and is protective of their owner. Chizers are seen as sweet, gentle, loving dogs, which tend to be great lap dogs for their owners, and tend to shower affection upon their owners with cuddling lots and many kisses. It is a generally playful breed, and will play for a long time before tiring out and eventually taking a nap. This breed needs daily walks, and constant activity time in order to keep the breed on its best behaviour. The chizer is a good breed for single people or families without children, as it takes serious socialization towards children for the chizer to be comfortable. This breed has be known to nip at small children, and will not take kindly to any children forcefully playing with it. The chizer is a breed that is generally fairly shy, and tends to be scared when meeting new people or other dogs, and again socialization at a young age can alleviate this issue. The chizer is an extremely intelligent dog, and are easy to train due to their intelligence. However, they need a good amount of training to prevent from nipping, and chewing; as they are a breed that loves to chew anything they can find. They have the ability to pick up things very fast, and learn all sorts of commands.  However, it is tough to train the chizer to stop barking, as due to their innate sense of hearing, they hear the slightest noise and will bark at anything; they make perfect guard dogs that way. Also, the chizer breed does not like the cold, and does not cope well is cold temperatures, mostly due to its small stature; therefore, this makes it difficult to train these dogs to go to the bathroom outside, as most chizers tend to be paper or pad trained. This can also make it difficult in winter climates to take the breed for the daily walk required, as most chizers will not go outside in anything past -10 Celsius.",CAR_3f24fb156d036d88bfe464a8b2644f4d506eb141,0," Alopekis dogs represent a type dating back to the pre-specialisation era, since they combine hunting, herding and guarding abilities and other primitive characteristics of conformation and behaviour. The passage from Ctesias, mentioned by Julius Pollux, about the Cynomolgus dogs of Crete ), is especially interesting, as it refers to dogs co-existing with buffalo  cattle herds and even suckling the milking cows and competing with bulls. It is possible that descendants of those dogs travelled to Northern Europe with the Greeks, the Romans, the Celts and later the Romani people (according to folk traditions) and contributed to breeds such as the Welsh Corgi  and the Lancashire Heeler. The ancestors of the latter are said to have been brought to Britain by Romani people from the Mediterranean. The fact that these breeds are the only (together with the Alopekis) small  size contemporary breeds specializing in cattle-driving and herding (cattle dogs being in their vast majority much larger and of molossoid  molosser type), is quite remarkable in itself; it could also be seen as additional evidence, apart from the obvious physical similarities, that there is a shared genetic relation and common adaptation and specialization of the herding instinct in all these three breeds, originating in the Eastern regions of Crete (where marshland habitats were ideal for water buffalo herds), given the specific importance of the bull worship in the island's ancient history. The Bull games or Taurokathapsia (Bull-leaping), a form of gymnastics performed by young acrobats and bulls in ancient Crete, are quite well-known; reading Ctesias' report, one wonders if dogs were ever included, or used to control any bull that became too aggressive during the games or the training sessions. (This passage also underlines the co-existence and inevitable genetic interaction between Cretan populations of Alopekis and Cretan Hounds . According to a very interesting report recorded by the Hellenic Association for the Protection and Rescue of Native Farm and Domestic Animals Breeds Amaltheia, there was until very recently a group of Alopekis dogs escorting water buffalo herds in Northern Greece . One of the areas where the breed still co-exists with water buffalo (brought to Greece by invading armies during the Persian Wars) is Serres . And the breed still serves flocks of sheep and goats and cattle also, in other parts of the country, to this day (see pictures).",CAR_3fc2df38904803a250ab5b4324bed370f9e5b805,0," In 1935, Dutch breeder Leendert Saarloos (18841969) started cross-breeding a German Shepherd male to a female European wolf (Canis lupus lupus) which he obtained from Diergaarde Blijdorp, the Rotterdam Zoo. Although he was passionate about the German Shepherd, he found most dogs to be too domesticated and wanted to breed in more natural properties in order to get better working dogs. The result wasn't entirely what Saarloos had hoped for. This breed is cautious, reserved and lacks the ferocity to attack. Until Leendert Saarloos died in 1969, he was in full control over the breeding of his European wolfdog. The Dutch Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1975. To honour its creator they changed the name to Saarloos Wolfdog. In 1981 the breed was recognized by the Fdration Cynologique Internationale (FCI). In the past, some Saarloos wolfdogs were trained as guide dogs for the blind and as rescue dogs, but most dogs of this breed are currently kept as family dogs.",CAR_4762fb9dbad2366400848e6b1d3be09f1b7ec6e3,0,,

These tiny dogs thrive on strong and dependable relationships with humans, love to receive affection and play the role of lap dog during down time. This breed is highly intelligent and generally responds well to basic training and commands. As a pet, the Prague Ratter is obedient, loyal, loving, and very affectionate. The Prague Ratter adapts well to full-time indoor and apartment living, yet still enjoys spending time outdoors, playing games such as fetch, and taking long and leisurely walks. They are also known to be a very quiet dog unlike many other small dogs who tend to be very yappy. Like any small dog one should be wary of allowing them to develop Small Dog Syndrome as they can become aggressive if they are not well-socialized from an early age.",CAR_4ec1b8713a239f2ec34dc09499046798337005b1,0," Despite legality issues, dogs are still commonly used for fighting purposes all across the continent. The American Pit Bull Terrier is the most popular breed used for fighting, but foreign breeds, such as the Dogo Argentino (used widely in South America), and to a lesser extent, the Presa Canario are also gaining popularity. The Dogo Argentino is now often seen in dog fight circuits in areas of the United States where the American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT) has been banned. In Miami-Dade County, Florida, where the APBT, American Staffordshire Terrier, and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier (or any other dog that substantially conforms to any of these breeds' characteristics) is banned, the Dogo Argentino has become the main fighting dog of choice, being used at both organized and street level dogfighting.",CAR_5182c097c01d5d1ab3ce61d1d4d7e9ff00dccb36,0,,
