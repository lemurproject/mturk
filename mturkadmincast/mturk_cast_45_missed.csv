Beverly Pisano, in her book, Irish Wolfhounds, T.F.H publications,inc., writes that the Great Dane, Scottish Deerhound and Borzoi contributed to the resurrected Irish wolfhound. The modern Irish Wolfhound has a more peaceful temperament than its ancestor, the CU, of Ireland. Some Irish Wolfhounds have the power to excel as a guard, but too many of them have been bred to be passive for the show ring.  The Anatolian shepherd, the Kangal, the Akbash, the Tibetan Mastiff, the Kuvasz, the Mid-Asian shepherd, Caucasian shepherd ( the Caucasian Shepherd,along with the East German Shepherd dog,guarded the Berlin Wall,to catch East Germans who wished to escape to the free West Germany)  and the great white guardian breeds of Asia, are very serious guardian breeds.","CAR_081b80efc1c56a421058a8948af9c3846d22e21c","0"," The best of these dogs were bred together, to combine the qualities of each breed to create a running dog that could cope with Australia's harsh and rugged conditions. The Greyhound was used for its speed and fantastic eyesight, while the Deerhound blood added tougher feet, a thicker coat, a more powerful body and excellent stamina. There is evidence that other running and working dog breeds such as Borzoi, Whippet, Saluki and Irish Wolfhound were added into the mix, but the majority of the heritage comes from greyhound and deerhound lines.","CAR_0bec689a0b103100aca78a75d1207800599facc7","0"," During the English Conquest of Ireland, only the nobility were allowed to own Irish Wolfhounds, the numbers permitted depending on position. They were much coveted and were frequently given as gifts to important personages and foreign nobles. Wolfhounds were the companions of the regal, and were housed themselves alongside them.

There is a romantic story of a blue dog swimming ashore from a shipwreck: the coat of this dog was so lovely that it was mated with all the female Wheaten Terriers in Kerry (or in all Ireland, according to some), producing the Kerry Blue. Perhaps this story is not entirely myth, as the Portuguese Water Dog is often suggested as part of the Kerry's makeup. Others suggest the Kerry was produced by the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier crossed with the Bedlington Terrier with (or without) some Irish Wolfhound or Irish Terrier blood. The extinct Gadhar herding dog is also mentioned as another possible branch of the Kerry's family tree.
