B. Suryanarain Rao writes that peculiar powers seem to characterise the angular positions of the planets which enable persons born under such combinations to become kings (i.e. acquire ruling powers). In all such cases the strength and the placement of the lord of the Lagna ('Ascendant') is of paramount importance, if it happens to be weak in strength or ill-placed or otherwise afflicted, then auspicious results of good yogas are not experienced. If the lord of the Lagna vested with requisite strength is situated either in a kendra or in the 9th house in its Vargottama navamsa and the lord of the 9th is also either exalted or situated in its own sign attaining vargottama, then a powerful, wealthy and learned ruler is born; this yoga is also known as the Lakshmi Yoga. Other few examples that can be cited under this category are a) the Adhi yoga that arises if benefic planets are situated in the 6th, in the 7th and in the 8th house from the Moon, b) the Mahabhagya yoga which is caused if a male born during day-time has the Sun, the Moon and the Lagna, all three in odd signs or if a night-born female has these three in even signs, C) as Phaladeepika states  when a benefic sign is on the 10th house and the 10th house is occupied by a benefic planet and is aspected by a benefic or benefics and the lord of 10th not being combust occupies a benefic bhava in its own sign or exaltation sign the very favourable Khyati yoga arises making one adept, wealthy and achieve wide and lasting fame, who like a king will protect his subordinates and d) as Jataka Parijata states  if from the bhava occupied by the lord of the lagna the lord of the 4th, the planet occupying the 4th house, the lord of the 9th and the planet occupying the 9th house are all in Shubhvargas, strong and associated with the lagna the person will certainly become a long-lived, mighty and wealthy ruler. This last mentioned yoga is a very rare Raja yoga which will not arise in case the planets causing it are not directly connected with the lagna. Parashara states that if there be a malefic in the 10th house in Sayana-avastha or Bhojana-avastha the person will face many miseries on account of his own deeds but if the Moon is in the 10th in Kautaka-avastha or Prakasana-avastha there will undoubtedly be a Raja yoga.",CAR_25eec77abd330d40966e83a0161b960f93e319aa,0," He has conducted thousands of innovative and specialized yoga events.

Any one of the natural benefics - Mercury, Venus or Jupiter, strong and unafflicted or the strong lord of the Lagna situated in a kendra from the lagna cancels Balarishta. Parashara also states that if the 4th house is occupied by an evil planet and Jupiter is favourably placed or if Jupiter and Mars conjoin or Jupiter aspects Mars or if evil planets in the kendras are hemmed between benefic planets Balarishta yogas get cancelled. These are some of the favourable Arishtabhanga yogas. A strong Moon and a strong Lagna-lord are potent protective factors but even a strong Moon cannot escape from the influences exerted by other planets upon the signs and bhava not occupied by the Moon. N.Chidambaram Aiyar, for instance, has given sixteen planetary situations centering on the role of the three strong natural benefics and the strong lord of the lagna, and the Moon, which situations if also simultaneously existing counteract the ill-effect of several Balarishta yogas given in the texts, there will be no early death etc.;. The texts have also described special yogas cancelling Balarishta. For example, if Saturn is in Leo, Jupiter in the 12th (in Virgo) and the navamsa of Aries is devoid of a malefic, one born in Nirmalamsa does not incur Chandra Dosha (blemished Moon to cause Balarishta) Sloka 859 of Chandra Kala Nadi Mahadeva in his Jataka Tattva states that the Moon, weak and lustreless, situated in a sign owned by Venus, causes Balarishta, and the child dies at the age of seven years. But rarely does the Full Moon in the 7th act as a powerful maraka unless there is a strong malefic also situated in the 8th house, early death cannot result if the planet in 8th is aspected by a benefic planet.",CAR_40860b281ec7b30ea96d764e580d07a5e71924d2,0," Mallinson says Shiva Samhita exposes a yoga teaching yet also calls itself a tantra; he also describes it as an eclectic collection of yoga lore.

First of all swamiji practiced the Sadhana of religious faith and love of the Varkari Sampradaya and in short period he mastered Yoga Siddhi based on Patanjalis Yoga Sutras. The very first sight of the noble ascetic figure of Swamiji with his long matted hair, flowing beard and body typically smeared with ashes all over from head to feet, wearing neaklace of Rudraksha beads and scantily dressed, evoked deep awe and respect from all who saw him. Swamiji possessed unique powers which would inspire all those masses of people who came in contact with him, and transform their lives by bestowing on them heavenly beauty, bliss, joy and prosperity. That is why every one of his teachings was a powerful inspiration of constructive, universal and powerful instructions based on pure truth! A measure of the attraction of trust reposed by the common people in Swamiji could be gauged from the fact that at his mere bidding, more and more peoples started participating in the social services undertaken by him. By his divine power and because of the bestowal of parental attention, to mitigate the sufferings and calamities of the common people, Swamiji was held in great regard and respect. Swamiji inspired the huge and growing crowds of his devotees to switch their efforts from seeking individual salvation or welfare to acts which will ensure welfare of the entire universe! Through voluntary services (Shramdan) thousands of hands helped to transform barren lands which were lying uncultivated and discarded as wastelands, for hundreds of years, into luxurious greenery. Planting of a tree becomes a holy mission: every house and every village witnesses plantation of trees in their thousand of acres. In this way, Swamiji put in very strenuous efforts to minimize hazards of pollution, which is threatening to engulf the entire Universe! Thus the world became acquainted with the illustrious and divine powers of Swamiji to put into actual practice and operation, plans of noble work for the benefit of universal humanity. Swamiji taught the message that in this world nothing is without value, neither time, nor any article, nor any person! Father and Mother give birth to their child, but do not always give it a noble vision for living life (Jeevan Drishti). That is why it is absolutely necessary to bestow on the child good morals and proper education. A newborn child is like a lump of clay. However he is a future representative of Indias culture and destiny. That is why Swamiji through the example of his own actions, emphasized the need to concentrate on these qualities right from his childhood. In order to achieve this purpose, he established Gurukul type schools with hostels, based on our holy and ancient traditions and through his incomparable feats of meditations, will power and great efforts, started, sustained and expanded them. Every one proudly looks upon these institutions as efforts in the direction of constructive national activity! Even today one can see large numbers of students, who intend on aiming at merely earning riches in their future lives, engrossed in deep study in these Gurukul type of schools. Being a self realized Saint, Swamiji fully realized and knew that if organized strength of the community is wrongly harnessed to wicked  crooked thinking  then it will only cause havoc and destruction in the Universe! Swamiji, who always consistently abhorred wealth, status, titles and publicity for himself, led a life of severe hard work and presence up to his age of 75 years  fully devoted to general welfare of the masses and striving for world peace. Because of his life of sacrifice, even though Swamiji discarded his mortal body to the five elements of nature on 10121989   by his miraculous deeds he remains immortal  deathless and everlasting.

He clearly understood the necessity to change his life to prevent further decline and to restore the health of body and mind. He started to seek for a way to realize this and eventually, in 1979, his general interest for Yoga was aroused. He was very impressed when he read the Indian classical epic Bhagavad Gita and ancient scriptures such as the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, the Shiva Samhita, the Gheranda Samhita, the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali and others. Finally, in 1980, he discovered the books of Dhirendra Brahmachari Yoga hilft heilen and Yoga progressiv (English titles: Yogic Sukshma Vyayama and Yogasana Vijnana).
