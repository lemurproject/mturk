All of these, in one way or another, related to improvements to the toilet or associated devices.  The toilet was not the invention of a single person.  It evolved into its present form through contributions from various sources.  The Romans had toilets that conveyed away waste with running water.  In the 1590s, Englishman, Sir John Harington (15611612) contrived a crude flush toilet.  However, Haas' efforts, perhaps more so than those of any other one person, helped transform the toilet from a notoriously unreliable device into the modern commode.",CAR_02d7986bbd451f51afc8a1ff4dbb8dc423567b93,0," Serious waterborne diseases such as cholera and diarrhea occur when open defecation or poor sanitation permits human waste to pollute water supplies. Historically, sanitation has been a concern from the earliest stages of human settlements. The Indus Valley Civilization is particularly notable for its extensive sanitation works, including private flush toilets. For the most part, early cities emptied their waste into rivers or seas manually or via open ditches. Sanitation in ancient Rome was notably advanced, as were some of the reredorters of medieval monasteries, but emptying of chamber pots into city streets continued into the modern era. A precursor to the modern flush toilet system was designed by John Harington in 1596 but did not become common until the late 19th century. Even London, at that time the world's largest city, did not require indoor toilets in its building codes until after the First World War.",CAR_07142d6ac6d1dd0ecec4cd00c956b9bc5cf66c78,0," Toilet was originally a French loanword (first attested in 1540) that referred to the toilette (little cloth) draped over one's shoulders during hairdressing. During the late 17th century, the term came to be used by metonymy in both languages for the whole complex of grooming and body care that centered at a dressing table (also covered by a cloth) and for the equipment composing a toilet service, including a mirror, hairbrushes, and containers for powder and makeup. The time spent at such a table also came to be known as one's toilet; it came to be a period during which close friends or tradesmen were received as toilet-calls.",CAR_073c7db14518d5bfd16f10bc7cd6d995ecc69950,0," Other features may include a heated seat, which may be adjustable from 30 C to 40 C; an automatic lid equipped with a proximity sensor, which opens and closes based on the location of the user. Some play music to relax the user's sphincter  (some Inax toilets, for example, play the first few phrases of Op. 62 Nr. 6 Frhlingslied by Felix Mendelssohn). Other features are automatic flushing, automatic air deodorizing, and a germ-resistant surface. Some models specially designed for the elderly may include armrests and devices that help the user to stand back up after use. A soft close feature slows the toilet lid down while closing so the lid does not slam onto the seat, or in some models, the toilet lid will close automatically a certain time after flushing. The most recent introduction is the ozone deodorant system that can quickly eliminate smells. Also, the latest models store the times when the toilet is used and have a power-saving mode that warms the toilet seat only during times when the toilet is likely to be used based on historic usage patterns. Some toilets also glow in the dark or may even have air conditioning below the rim for hot summer days. Another recent innovation is intelligent sensors that detect someone standing in front of the toilet and initiate an automatic raising of the lid (if the person is facing away from the toilet) or the lid and seat together (if someone is facing the toilet).",CAR_0ad500875cd2c110697e64818ac66fd40f31adec,0," The history of drainage, sanitary services, sewerage systems and public toilets takes its place within the general history of public health in Queensland.

The trailer, which runs two minutes and fourteen seconds, features dialogue and scenes that are absent from the final version of the film. For example, at the scene of Jack's first press conference, Yoji asks, have you ever slept with Madonna? During his first meeting with Uchiyama, Jack responds to the demand to shave his moustache by saying, he probably can't even grow one. In the locker room scene where Jack is confused about how to use the Japanese-style toilet, he quips to Max, I need somebody to tell me how to go to the can (later changed in the final version of the film to I need somebody tell me how to take a crap). The music in the trailer is mostly sampled from Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack, but also includes samples from Turning Japanese by the The Vapors.

Similar to powder room, toilet then came to be used as a euphemism for rooms dedicated to urination and defecation, particularly in the context of signs for public toilets, as on trains. Finally, it came to be used for the plumbing fixtures in such rooms (apparently first in the United States) as these replaced chamber pots, outhouses, and latrines.

2,35_1,35,1," <span>Tell me about the history of toilets.</span>"," Toilets accounted for almost 30% of residential indoor water use in the United States in 1999. One flush of a standard U.S. toilet requires more water than most individuals, and many families, in the world use for all their needs in an entire day.A homes toilet water sustainability can be improved in one of two ways: improving the current toilet or installing a more efficient toilet.  To improve the current toilet, one possible method is to put weighted plastic bottles in the toilet tank.  Also, there are inexpensive tank banks or float booster available for purchase.  A tank bank is a plastic bag to be filled with water and hung in the toilet tank. A float booster attaches underneath the float ball of pre-1986 three and a half gallon capacity toilets.  It allows these toilets to operate at the same valve and float setting but significantly reduces their water level, saving between one and one and a third gallons of water per flush.  A major waste of water in existing toilets is leaks.  A slow toilet leak is undetectable to the eye, but can waste hundreds of gallons each month.  One way to check this is to put food dye in the tank, and to see if the water in the toilet bowl turns the same color.  In the event of a leaky flapper, one can replace it with an adjustable toilet flapper, which allows self-adjustment of the amount of water per flush.",CAR_211a0a9aafa83682f475a80ae48345317e90a99e,0," Before the candidate is taken out onto the road, the examiner asks two questions about car maintenance and safety.

Kyoichiro still holding onto defeat tells Shinnosuke he will always be Shocker's lapdog for having Rider 1 and 2's blood on his hands, but Shinnosuke tells him he can always still make up for it. The Great Leader of Shocker's brain appears suddenly and absorbs Rider 3, becoming the Kamen Rider shaped Rider Robo, revealing how he changed history. Drive figures out that the race was allowed to happen so that he could absorb the strongest rider. In its high powered state, The Great Leader threatens to erase the concept of Kamen Rider from history. Every Shocker Rider attacks Shinnosuke, who responds by becoming Drive and attacking them all with his Tire Changes. As they all battle, Rider Robo assaults all the riders. Meanwhile, the children set free Kiriko and Yuto. Gen tries to stop them by becoming Cheetahkatatsumuri, but Deneb appears and fires them off of the scaffolding. Yuto transforms into Zeronos Zero Form, wielding the Denebick Buster. Blade, Chalice, Garren, and Leangle awaken to justice and fight the Shocker Riders. BLACK RX, Mach and Faiz join Drive but cannot take on Rider Robo. However, Kamen Riders 1 and 2 will their souls out of the History Modifying Machine, revealing that they lived in its artificial brain secretly, and waited for the moment they would have the chance to defeat Shocker by escaping through exploiting the machine's revival ability. Kamen Rider 1 and 2 awaken justice in all the Kamen Riders. Cheetahkatatsumuri and General Black, who was Hiruchameleon all along, call on Shocker's most powerful members to join the fight, but Kamen Rider J appears to fight Rider Robo himself. Rider Robo erases J from history with its History Erasing Beam, and does this to all the Legendary Riders as well. Kamen Rider 3 awakens to justice and wills himself out of the machine, destroying its capacity to erase things from history.

Yoshitaka says the ninjas don't have enough Nintality as they struggle with Rider Robo and creates the Tridoron Shuriken, and disappears. Drive uses the Shuriken on his Handle-Ken to form Shurikenjin Tridoron, which makes Tridoron a part of Shurikenjin, allowing Drive to help pilot it. While the other Riders take out the remaining Shocker members, Mach does not make it, but his death inspires the Riders to fight harder to avenge him. Shurikenjin Tridoron in turn defeats Rider Robo with Tridoron Finish, destroying its hold on history. All the Kamen Riders wish Rider 3 goodbye.

In upper-class homes, the first modern lavatories were washrooms with sinks located near the bedrooms; in lower-class homes, there was often only a collapsible tub for bathing. In Britain, there was long a prejudice against having the toilet located in the bathroom proper: in 1904, Hermann Muthesius noted that a lavatory i.e., toilet is practically never found in an English bathroom; indeed it is considered downright inadmissible to have one there.

To keep the two areas separated, shoes are taken off before entering the house so that the unclean shoes do not touch the clean area inside of the house. Historically, toilets were located outside of the house, and shoes were worn for a trip to the toilet. Nowadays, the toilet is almost always inside the home and hygienic conditions have improved significantly, but the toilet is still considered an unclean area.

11,35_1,35,1," <span>Tell me about the history of toilets.</span>"," The urinal was built in 1919 and is situated in Russell Street opposite the Toowoomba railway station. The immediate social context for the urinal is to be found in the relevant history of Toowoomba. By the late nineteenth century, the lack of sanitation in Toowoomba became a pressing local issue. Earth closets were in a disgraceful condition and typhoid fever was prevalent. It was in these circumstances that Toowoomba's health program, and that of Queensland generally, began to take shape. Boards of Health were established but no real success was achieved until the first years of the twentieth century. Despite improved sanitary services, Toowoomba had 98 cases of enteric fever (typhoid) in 1916 although by 1918 this had dropped to 17. The foremost mover in these plans was Dr Thomas Arthur Price, public health advocate and mayor of Toowoomba in 1919. The lack of a sewerage system had a major effect upon the provision and type of sanitation, especially for public toilets. Until a sewerage system was installed, all public toilets either had to be in a location where they could be cleaned by a pan service or else operated purely as urinals where the urine could be flushed away to a drain as normal dirty water. A pan service could scarcely be provided in the middle of busy city streets. It is for this reason that women's toilets were located in buildings or some discreet spot, while men could enjoy the use of dedicated urinals in the streets. This was the situation in Toowoomba until 1919. Public toilets with closets were available at the Toowoomba railway station for both men and women and there were a number of iron urinals for men in the streets of the city. These iron urinals were equipped with a water tank for the purposes of cleansing. They operated successfully, but in 1918, the Council recommended their removal and planned better facilities. This is when the new toilet in Russell Street was planned and built.",CAR_8eafc381976e3f39d88be9ef9e32c1c964193a21,0," Despite efforts to tell multicultural histories, history museums have a problem with diversity and inclusion.

Suddenly, herds of forest animals flee past their cabin, followed by two military helicopters, one containing Colonel Abraham Curtis (Morgan Freeman), that announce the area is now quarantined.  They both noticed that the fleeing animals had the same red splotches that they saw on Rick.  Jonesy and Beaver return to the cabin to find a trail of blood from the bedroom to the bathroom, where Rick sits semi-catatonic on the toilet, the room covered with blood.  As Beaver tries to wake Rick, he teeters and falls off the toilet, dead into the tub as a creature writhes and screams in the toilet.  Beaver quickly slams the toilet seat down and sits on it to trap the creature.  As Beaver is trying to take a new toothpick out of his container, he fumbles and all of his toothpicks scatter on the floor.  Beaver is compulsive about his toothpicks and as he tries to reach over and pick one up from the floor, he slips on the blood and falls of the toilet.  A three-foot long lamprey-like creature, with multiple rows of razor-sharp teeth, emerges from the toilet bowl and attacks a disoriented Beaver.  He fights it but the creature kills him just before Jonesy returns from the tool shed with the duct tape.  Jonesy manages to shut the bathroom door, trapping the creature, but he has an eerie feeling that something is behind him.  As he turns around he is confronted by a large alien called Mr. Grey, who turns into a fine red mist, just like the red splotches on the animals and on Rick, and possesses Jonesy's body and emits a red dust around the entire cabin.",CAR_a9601862f56eed3ab59b1324eddd75a8c63ee77e,0,

The Toto product Washlet Zoe is listed in Guinness World Records as the world's most sophisticated toilet with seven functions. However, as the model was introduced in 1997, it is now likely to be inferior to the latest model by Toto, Neorest. The idea for the washlet came from abroad, and the first toilet seat with integrated bidet was produced in the United States in 1964. The age of the high-tech toilet in Japan started in 1980 with the introduction of the Washlet G Series by Toto, and since then the product name washlet has been used to refer to all types of Japanese high-tech toilets. As of 2002, almost half of all private homes in Japan have such a toilet, exceeding the number of households with a personal computer.

A squat toilet differs from a Western toilet in both construction and method of employment. A squat toilet essentially looks like a miniature urinal set horizontally into the floor. Most squat toilets in Japan are made of porcelain, although in some cases (as on trains) stainless steel is used instead. The user squats over the toilet, facing the hemispherical hood, i.e., the wall in the back of the toilet in the picture seen on the right. A shallow trough collects the waste, instead of a large water-filled bowl as in a Western toilet. All other fixtures, such as the water tank, piping, and flushing mechanism, may be identical to those of a Western toilet. Flushing causes water to push the waste matter from the trough into a collecting reservoir which is then emptied, with the waste carried off into the sewer system. The flush is often operated in the same manner as a Western toilet, though some have pull handles or pedals instead. Many Japanese toilets have two kinds of flush: small () and large (). The difference is in the amount of water used. The former is for urine (in Japanese, literally small excretion) and the latter for feces (large excretion). The lever is often pushed to the small setting to provide a continuous covering noise for privacy, as discussed below.",CAR_f1e6576ddb48ced08cd7c0dfef5d436c1f8d02a6,0," The toilet circuit is the network of small music venues in the United Kingdom which rising indie, rock and metal bands often visit to gain support and promote themselves.

For example, the inside of the house is considered a clean area, whereas the outside of the house is considered unclean. To keep the two areas separated, shoes are taken off before entering the house so that the unclean shoes do not touch the clean area inside of the house. Historically, toilets were located outside of the house, and shoes were worn for a trip to the toilet. Nowadays, the toilet is almost always inside the home and hygienic conditions have improved significantly, but the toilet is still considered an unclean area. To minimize contact between the unclean toilet floor and the clean floor in the rest of the house, many private homes and also some public toilets have  in front of the toilet door that should be used when in the toilet and removed right after leaving the toilet. This also indicates if the toilet is in use. They can be as simple as a pair of rubber slippers, decorated slippers with prints of anime characters for small children, or even animal fur slippers. A frequent faux pas of foreigners is to forget to take off the toilet slippers after a visit to the restroom, and then use these in the non-toilet areas, hence mixing the clean and unclean areas.",CAR_41190ffa0b4008c19f5a70a3ae91c8f1fdc43ed9,0," They go on to tell Smecker the events that happened: Right after the MacManus brothers offered a drink and a stool to the Russian mobsters. Rocco, aka The Funny Man, interrupts, telling a joke about the head mobsters mother, in which the mobster replies with a sucker punch that knocks Rocco out. As Rocco lie in pain, Connor and Murphy speak to the mobsters in Russian, as they look on in disbelief, take a shot, then proceed to return the favor, sucker punching the Russian. A brawl ensues, where the brothers and friends, over match and overpower the out numbered mobsters. One mobster is taken out with a couple of liquor bottles to the head. At the end, the main Russian is tied to the top of the counter, while Connor proceeds to pour liquor on the Russians posterior and lights it on fire. The scene ends with the Russian screaming in pain, butt aflame. The next morning, as the MacManus brothers are waking up in their lower class apartment. Two of the Russians, still bandaged from the fight the night before. Come barging in, in pursuit of vengeance. Catching the brothers off guard, guns in their face, they cuff Connor to the toilet, and take Murphy to the alley. Connor, from the fear of losing his brother, somehow is able to pull the toilet from its hinges, and makes his way, toilet still in his arms, to the roof above the alley way. Just as the Russian is about to shoot Murphy. Connor drops the toilet on the Russians head and jumps on the back of the other. When Murphy gets up, Connor now unconscious, he takes a piece of the broken toilet and beats the other Russian over the head until he isn't moving. He grabs their guns, money, and all the other evidence, puts them in a bag, then pulls his unconscious brother over his back and leaves. After they retell their incident to Smecker, he declines to press charges and allows them to spend the night in a holding cell to avoid attention from the media. That night, they receive what appears to be a calling from God telling them to hunt down wicked men so that the innocent will flourish.",CAR_4161623fc95c3810a8f0ea2c2161f2baafc9bfc0,0," At the University of Oxford, following the resolution made by Council on 8 May 2002, Michaelmas Term begins on and includes 1 October and ends on and includes 17 December.

Adonis denies he has killed Brinsley, but is clearly being secretive about something. One afternoon, when he is normally lecturing, Dr. Awkward accidentally meets Adonis in his office and he starts kissing her. However, when Hannah starts scrabbling at his trousers like a deranged dormouse, Adonis stops her and tells her he's impotent. When she tells Albumen about this, he knows something must be wrong, and when they ask Adonis whether he would like to go to a sex therapist, he reveals what has really been going on. As it turns out, Adonis has been mapping human DNA in his secret laboratory for the last few years, and has already started cloning people as well, namely Albumen (a spare one, in case something happens to the original) and himself. Adonis's clone has evidently murdered Sheridan Brinsley, but when the clone comes over to the apartment, no one can tell who is the real Adonis. The real Adonis then tells the police inspector about a microdot he put between the buttocks of his clone in order to tell them apart. This turns out to be a bluff, but it becomes clear that the clone has no genitals (as Adonis puts it: teflon groin) which is convincing enough.

52,35_2,35,2," Tell me about the history of toilets.<br/><span>Where does the term toilet come from?</span>"," It's the last few weeks of the Summer vacation and Elizabeth is getting a bit bored and lonely, so her mother springs a surprise on her in the form of Arabella. Elizabeth is excited but soon finds out she doesn't like Arabella very much and the dislike is mutual, but Elizabeth decides to do her best to hide her dislike, telling herself Be careful, Elizabeth Allen. You're very good at making enemies, but as you found last term, that only makes things difficult for you and your friends. Arabella's a silly, empty-headed doll. You let Whyteleafe deal with her and don't try to cure her all by yourself, Thankfully school restarts soon and Elizabeth won't have to have anything to do with Arabella unless she wants to. As well as Arabella, there are three new students that term; two boys and one girl. Martin seems a pleasant enough chap. Julian is an excellent mimic and very, very clever but he is very untidy, lazy and lackadaisical and Rosemary is a nice girl, but is very timid and weak. Elizabeth soon sees Julian right at the bottom of the form and says Julian, you really ought to try to be top Couldn't be bothered he says Who wants to learn about the tallest mountains? I'm not going to climb them. Who wants to learn history dates? I'll forget them when I grow up, so I couldn't care less. Lessons are pointless and anyway, you're just telling me to work hard because you're a goody-goody monitor. Elizabeth goes to walk off in a huff, but Julian says Oh, c'mon, I'm only teasing. Your friend Joan is in a higher form now, so you won't see much of her for quite a while, so why don't you make friends with me? and Elizabeth does so. At the next meeting, Julian makes a noise like a bubbling saucepan and poor Elizabeth is stuck between a rock and a hard place. She knows she should report him, but he's a new boy and her new best friend. She glares at him and he stops and William says It is not funny to hold up a school meeting and Elizabeth takes the money box round and Arabella does not put all her money in; she keeps a pound to herself and Rosemary gives the game away when she says that peppermint chocolates are such good value. Jenny goes to have a look in Arabella's cubicle and sees the chocolates in her music case Arabella has kept money back and spent it all on chocolates! How mean she tells her form in disgust Well says Harry let's show her what we think of her! I bet at the next meeting she'll put all her money in the box. and everyone gives Arabella the cold shoulder and at the next meeting she says The whole form is making fun of me for no reason that I can see. William asks someone to explain why they're giving Arabella such a hard time and Jenny says Well, William, Arabella kept money back for herself and spent it all on chocolates William consults Elizabeth about it, but she has to say she doesn't really know what Jenny is talking about. Arabella is made to give all her change to Elizabeth and will only have ten pence that week. When the meeting breaks up she says Why didn't someone tell me about Arabella? I felt like a fool! and Jenny explains that she thought Arabella was her friend. One day, Rosemary has to say her money keeps disappearing and no, she hasn't got a hole in her pocket, so Elizabeth marks a coin to see if it disappears and if so, who could have been mean enough to take it and on the next rainy day, the children spin coins and Julian has the marked coin. Elizabeth tackles him over it and Julian denies having stolen it and they split up. Arabella spreads a rumour and Julian plays tricks on Elizabeth to pay her back. In Miss Ranger's class, the books seem to leap off the desk by themselves and Miss Ranger is not pleased Go out of the room, Elizabeth! Once was probably an accident, twice may have been but not three times. You're a monitor and you should know that that sort of behaviour is not acceptable in a class room Elizabeth goes and horror of horrors, here comes Rita I was sent outside, but it was for something that wasn't my fault she explains but Rita says Don't let it happen again. You know that monitors should not do things that get them sent outside. In the French teacher's class, mysterious drops of water fall on Elizabeth's head Ooh she says what is happening? The French teacher thinks Elizabeth is horsing around and says One more sound out of you and you go outside. This is a classroom, not a circus and Elizabeth makes up her mind not to make another sound; she'd rather get saturated than sent outside again. At the end of class, Harry says Elizabeth, how could you behave like that? Let me feel your head. and unfortunately it's as dry as a bone, so Elizabeth doesn't have a leg to stand on. Arabella's birthday comes up and she decides to have a midnight feast and doesn't tell Elizabeth who that night hears a terrific BANG! and when she goes to investigate, she sees Julian with biscuits in his hand Julian she says you're stealing biscuits now! Put them back at once! and in the process makes an awful noise, so the midnight feast has to be cancelled. Julian puts sneezing powder in Elizabeth's French book and she starts sneezing helplessly. She is told to stop and has to say I can't A-TISH-OOOOOO help it and is sent outside again and William comes along, sees her not sneezing there and thinks Elizabeth was just playing a childish prank. She reports Julian for stealing the biscuits, but Arabella explains that they were part of the midnight feast menu and poor Elizabeth realizes that she was wrong about at least the biscuits. William says Elizabeth, you have accused Julian wrongly of stealing and also twice you have been thrown out of the room for playing stupid pranks. That is not the behaviour of a monitor, so you must step down and we will choose someone else in your place. Elizabeth rushes out in tears and Julian begins to feel a bit guilty I know she accused me wrongly of stealing, but she didnt really play the fool in class; her behaviour was really the results of my tricks thinks Julian. Elizabeth is summoned to Williams office and she explains why she thought Julian was a thief. Julian is then summoned and says Oh, I see. A lolly of Elizabeths fell out of my pocket, did it? And there was a marked coin in my pocket? So thats why Elizabeth accused me of stealing, eh? Well, I can now see her point, but I never laid a finger on her lollies or money; someone must have tried to frame me. Anyway, it was not Elizabeths fault she got kicked out of class twice. He turns to Elizabeth and says Elizabeth, I put some springs under your books and that was what made them fly off your desk. I also put some pellets above your head so theyd leak water on you. And I put sneezing powder in your French book. Elizabeth laughs when she remembers what happened, her books flying off the desk in particular and she laughs Youre a real sport says Julian I never thought youd laugh when I told you about the tricks I played on you. Now I like you almost as much as I did before, so will you be my friend again? Oh, yes she says. Elizabeth is a bit mopey and serious for a few days, so Julian plays a trick in the science class and everyone ends up rolling in the aisles with laughter and suddenly everyones friendly again. At the next meeting William says Julian, you should use your brains for work and not just for jokes and tricks. Oh, I couldnt care less about being bottom Julian replies rudely I see says William kindly but I must warn you punishment will come for your laziness and it will, alas be a terrible one Its soon time for the kids end of term outing and Julians mother isnt there yet and Julian reckons the car must have broken down, but he soon finds out the reason for his mothers lateness is far more sinister; shes suddenly very, very ill. Julian races out into the garden and when Elizabeth finds him, he wails My mothers very, very ill; she mightnt live. Why didnt I use my brains for good, worthwhile work instead of only for tricks and jokes? I know my mother couldnt care less about grades, but I wish now Id been top instead of bottom. William was right, punishment was awaiting me and it could not have been a more terrible one. Martin starts to feel very uncomfortable and finally decides to own up that he was the one who was the thief and who framed Julian You horrid thief! she cries You nasty, beastly, rotten, double-faced thief! So it was you who put that coin and those lollies of mine into Julians pocket! Think of all the damage youve done. Because of you I thought that Julian was a thief and I accused him and he played tricks that got me sent outside and I lost my position as a monitor. How could you sleep at night? getting up and walking away. She goes to the music practice room and Rosemary comes in Why were you so beastly to Martin? she asks You know hes so kind and generous and Elizabeth thinks Martin really is a puzzle. How can one person be both kind and unkind; both mean and generous? It just doesnt make sense. The maths class is interrupted by a phone call for none other than Julian and he comes back and says My mums better. MY MUMS BETTER! Miss Ranger lets the class off early; nobody will be able to do any more lessons; theyre too hyper. That night, Elizabeth simply cannot sleep so she goes to have a look at Williams Big Book to see if theres any explanation for Martins strange behaviour and she finds an article about a girl named Tessa who stole things to give to others to win their favour and thats basically what Martin does. Elizabeth confronts Martin and he says I feel simply dreadful, Elizabeth. What can I do to make things better? Well, theres only one thing to do and a coward like you would never do it. You ought to own up at the next school meeting., and lo and behold, just as the meeting is about to break up a voice says Hang on. Ive got something to say and it is Martin William he says I was the one who stole the biscuits, cakes, money and lollies and I planted the marked coin on Julian so everyone would think it was him, not me. I would never have owned up except Julians mother was ill and I hated to think I did that to someone who was so miserable. Also, someone said I was a coward and Im not really Aww thinks Elizabeth look at that. He so badly wanted people to like him and they dont seem to, and now hes had to confess something that will make them dislike him even more. That was a brave thing to do., standing up and saying Well, it wasnt the usual kind of stealing, it wasnt just badness. You see, he stole things to give to people to win their favour. Theres an article in the book about a girl, whose name was Tessa who behaved just like him. Wait a minute and Ill find it., turning to the right page How did you know about Tessa? asks William Well, Martin told me all hed done and I was disgusted she says but all the same, the kids say hes kind and I wondered what made Martin tick, so I looked in the book and found that. Well, Martin says William kindly you cant just buy friends; you have to earn them, so dont steal any more things from your fellows; just be kind, generous and fun to be with and youll soon have more friends than you can count. The meeting finally breaks up and theres only time for an apology from Martin to Julian and a quick dinner. Near the end of the term, Elizabeth gets more than she bargained for on her walk with Julian when some kid falls into the lake. She rescues him and comes back to school dripping wet. She changes her clothes and saunters back to dinner, not wanting any fuss, but at the next school meeting they hear about the heroic deed. It was Elizabeth says Julian it was our Elizabeth Everyone cheers her on and Elizabeth is asked to choose a reward and she says Well, theres a fair on in a nearby town, so could you please let everyone have a few days off to go there? and Miss Best agrees. Julian then stands up and says And please make Elizabeth a monitor again; she deserves it., and his request is also granted",CAR_4d3c60d0abbe206aa001e7d6f4e8dfe076ea17fd,0," And Varun asks for more money and asks them to meet him at the same cliff. Vinnie stole money from her mom's locker. He tried to kill them in the cliff when Sanjana came by searching for Ela and Vinnie. She has seen their video message in which they confessed everything to her. Sanju defended her best friends and said to Varun that he is still the bad guy. If he wants to kill them he should kill her first. Varun hesitated and said he never wanted to kill them just wanted Ela and Vinnie to know that how it feels to come near death.

When Sanju asks him why he was following Sanju he tells that Prithvi has told him to watch her and that he loves Sanju very much. He tells them that Varun knew that Rohan was involved in illegal bike racing so he released Rohan from the jail. Sanju asked him if Prithvi suspected Varun.

According to dialect dictionaries, fixin' to is associated with southern speech and is most often defined as being a synonym of preparing to or intending to. In sentences like (a) fixin' to may mean something like about to or planning to. Sentence (b) expresses more the intention of doing something, in this case the speaker intended to come. However, some linguists, i.e. Marvin K. Ching, regard it as being a quasimodal rather than a verb followed by an infinitive. As can be found in the Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States, the term is used by 57% of the population of Upper Texas and by 43% in Lower Texas. It is a term used by all social groups, although more frequently by people with a lower social status than by members of the educated upper classes. Furthermore, it is more common in the speech of younger people than in that of older people. The term is also more prevalent in rural areas than in urban areas. In addition, the term functions as an indicator for being from the South. As Ching points out, the precise meaning of the term depends much upon its inherent linguistic meaning, which changes in shades of meaning with lexical and syntactic choice. In other words, the term is used in different situations with a variety of meanings. Nevertheless, the meaning is mostly clear to speaker and addressee when used in a particular situation and when both actors are familiar with the term fixin' to.",CAR_4fb09bddef14fcaa1a6849ab7f8fe6daadf340b5,0,"  In plumbing, a closet flange (also known as a toilet flange) is a pipe fitting (specifically, a type of flange) that both mounts a toilet to the floor and connects the toilet drain to a drain pipe.

Citing the example of one of the first written applications of the Arabic term hashish to the Ismailis by 13th century historian Abu Shama, de Sacy demonstrated its connection to the name given to the Ismailis throughout Western scholarship. The first known usage of the term hashishi has been traced back to 1122 when the Fatimid caliph al-mir employed it in derogatory reference to the Syrian Nizaris. Used figuratively, the term hashishi connoted meanings such as outcasts or rabble. Without actually accusing the group of using the hashish drug, the Caliph used the term in a pejorative manner. This label was quickly adopted by anti-Ismaili historians and applied to the Ismailis of Syria and Persia. The spread of the term was further facilitated through military encounters between the Nizaris and the Crusaders, whose chroniclers adopted the term and disseminated it across Europe.",CAR_5e5337e01d10e973b75991a8446430759ed1dccd,0," This type of toilet is also called by many people an ecosan toilet as this name is quite easy to communicate with potential users at the local level.

Mikhail Shah is an arrogant and famous choreographer living in Goa who is also Baby's idol. Through a number of days, Baby is made the manager of Mikhail. Baby also secretly adores and loves Mikhail. She is heartbroken when she finds out that her boss is Mikhail's girlfriend named Nehtra. Nehtra is an arrogant, cunning, and two-timing girl who only knows how to use people for her advantage. Mikhail is making a show called Soulmates about the love of two people named Ruhaan(played by Mikhail) and Aneri. Mikhail has a difficult time finding Aneri although Nehtra wants him to make her Aneri. Mikhail denies saying that she dances with anger, not with love and passion. One day, Mikhail sees Baby dancing and loves how he dances. He tells her to become Aneri, but denies from the fear of her dad. Over some time, she agrees only for one month. This makes Nehtra jealous and tries some tactics, but fails. Mikhail finds out about this and breaks up with her saying she is a mean and sick person. However, one day Baby just leaves back to Delhi which angers Mikhail a lot. It is said that her grandmother was very sick and she is going to be coming back. As she is on the car ride, she gets an accident and gets her legs paralyzed. This makes her unable to dance. Baby becomes negative, cold, and bitter because of this. Mikhail promises to make her dance in a month though. Harry, Mikhail's best friend, thinks that he is running after dreams and hopes that can destroy his career, so he tells Baby to go back for the sake of Mikhail. Baby goes back to Delhi again. Mikhail doesn't know the real reason and starts hating Baby, even though he also starts missing her and developing feelings for her. Mikhail finds out the truth and Baby starts walking again after his therapist, Tarun, makes her watch Mikhail's dance videos. Harry and Nehtra start planning with each other, while Harry still hates Nehtra for using Mikhail and only plans with her for the benefits of Mikhail. Diya, who is Mikhail's best family friend and Harry's girlfriend, sees this and breaks up with him. Harry realizes where he went wrong and apologizes. Mikhail forgives him while Diya is still angry with him. Baby and Harry plan with each other and act like they like each other. Diya realizes she still loves him and goes back to him. They get back together. In this time, Mikhail gets jealous and goes to Baby to tell her to stop. However, Baby tells him the truth and says it was a plan to make Diya realize her love. She then explains how loves is gained and some people love others, but they don't know and by the time they do...it is too late. She indirectly tries to make Mikhail realize how much she loves him. Baby and Mikhail then dance together and spend time together, and then drops her home. Mikhail goes to the dance academy and realizes that he loves Baby. He says, Iska matlab hain ki mein uss idiot se pyaar karta hoon?!? Later on, he tells Harry about this and Nehtra overhears this. Nehtra calls Baby's dad and tells him everything and this is where the problems start. Tarun comes to Goa and tells her that her dad has sent her. She calls her dad and tells him to send him back because she doesn't like him. He tells her that she can only stay in Goa if she gets engaged to Tarun, or else she will have to come back. This shocks Baby and she starts crying as she only loves Mikhail. The same night, Mikhail comes to her doorstep and dances for her. She comes down and tells him that she is getting engaged to Tarun. Heartbroken Mikhail tells her that he loves her and asks her what she wants. She says that she is just listening to her dad, but doesn't tell him why she is listening to her dad. Angered by this, he drives back home. Tarun starts taunting Mikhail saying he has such a beautiful fiancee. On the day of the engagement, Mikhail calls Baby to come with him and she agrees.

Perhaps the most cited explanation is that chocolate comes from Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, from the word chocoltl, which many sources say derived from xocoltl , combining xococ, sour or bitter, and tl, water or drink. The word chocolatl does not occur in central Mexican colonial sources, making this an unlikely derivation.  Another derivation comes from the Yucatec Mayan word chokol meaning hot, and the Nahuatl atl meaning water. The Nahuatl term, chicolatl, meaning beaten drink, may derive from the word for the frothing stick, chicoli. The term chocolate chip was first used in 1940.

His family consists of him, his wife Nayyara(Ismat Zaidi) and three daughters Fala(Madiha Rizvi), Haya(Ayeza Khan) and Fariya(Aiman Khan). They all are well-mannered but middle class as compared to Shaista. Shaista always insults Nayyara and treats her daughters as servants.

Muskaan's father Nasir comes from Dubai with lots of things for her daughters and wife but Zeeshan is fine with it. Iraj likes a bottle of perfume because of which Muskaan is jealous and they start fighting like cats resulting in breaking of perfume bottle. But their mother Shaista is busy looking in things.

She is interrupted by Shaista and she says for a family photo. Naima tells Fala to come but Shaista insults Fala. Afterwards, Shaista calls Haya and Fala for work and gives them spoilt rotis for breakfast.The next day Iraj is talking loudly on her phone in Muskaan's room. Muskaan's phone also rings. It was Danish's call. Because of Iraj's voice, Muskaan cuts the phone and then later Iraj climbs on Muskaan and they start fighting. Their father comes. Meanwhile Danish comes to meet Muskaan and so Shaista calls Fala as a servant. Danish meets Fala and asks her for her reply of Ayaan's proposal. But Shaista says that her mother has rejected Ayaan's proposal. The next day Naima goes to Nayyara's house. Nayyara accepts her proposal of Ayaan for Fala. Zeeshan expresses his feelings for Haya towards Nasir. Nasir is very happy. Nasir says this to Baseer. Baseer is very excited. But Nayyara is not so happy because she thinks Haya will be sad at that home but later agrees. But Shaista refuses to do this. She hates Haya and says that she will never ever be my daughter-in-law. She thinks that Nayyara is taking revenge from Shaista of yesteryears fight which had happened between them during their young days over Nasir.

One is of Haya and Zeeshan and the other is of Fala and Ayaan. Iraj, Muskaan and Shaista are unhappy. Danish and his family visits Muskaan to decide the date of marriage.

She does not listen to Danish and once when her mother-in-law wants to go for a Get Together party, she makes her fun by saying that you are so old still you want to party. She insults her mother-in-law. Fala and Ayaan are happy with each other. But Sulaiman's mother and Ayaan's ex-wife Mariya comes to meet Sulaiman. Naima puts forth a condition that if she wants to meet her son, she has to take him forever. Ayaan and Fala are against it but they have to accept it. Shehryar betrays Iraj and leaves her. Iraj comes back and says the truth about jewellery. Nasir gets a heart attack and dies. His last wish is that Haya should be the daughter-in-law of the house.

Now Shaista's and her children's life has become a living hell. Haya is going to be remarried to her cousin. Zeeshan asks for forgiveness and reacceptance but Haya refuses. Hopes start rising for Iraj when Wahaj comes to takes her back. She goes with him. Meanwhile Shaista goes with Muskaan and Zeeshan in Nayyara's house to talk about Haya. She sees that Haya's rishta is fixed. Shaista is in a complete shock. Muskaan's mother-in-law comes to take her but she insults her by saying that she's doing a Melodrama and tamasha. She calls Danish and says I will come only if you leave your second wife and come to pick her up. He refuses. So, in anger she asks for Divorce. He gives her Divorce Papers. She is shocked.

A prime example of this is vaguada, which is a corruption of the English bad weather, though in Dominican Spanish the term has come to mean storm or torrential downpour, rather than a spot of unpleasant climate. Hence, a common Dominican expression: Viene una vaguada, here comes a vaguada, or here comes a storm. Another excellent example of this is boche, a corruption of the English bull shit, though in Dominican Spanish the term has come to mean a reprimanding, fulmination, or harangue in general terms. Hence, a common Dominican expression: Me echaron un boche, they threw me a boche, or they reprimanded me. The pronoun they in Dominican Spanish often refers to the third person singular, so that me dijeron, they told me, is sometimes used instead of a man told me, or a woman told me, or the young boy by the lemon tree told me. Furthermore, is the Dominican Spanish word for SUV, yipeta, jeepeta, or rarely gipeta. This term is a corruption of the American Jeep, which was the primary mode of transport for the GI's throughout the country during the occupation in the 1960s. Dominican license plates for SUVs are marked with a G for gipeta, a variant of, and pronounced like, yipeta, before their serial number. The word tichel, from T-shirt, also refers to a rugby shirt, association football jersey, or undershirt, and similarly, corn flakes and its variant con fli can refer to any breakfast cereal, in Dominican Spanish, be it puffed corn, bran flakes, or puffed wheat. The borrowing polo shirt is frequently pronounced polo ch.",CAR_866b5345557775902370c1c77205cffc2cd1a429,0," In some  languages, terms with a christening theme or etymology are preferred (e.g. baptme in Belgian French, doop in Belgian Dutch) or variations on a theme of navet and the rite of passage such as a derivation from a term for freshman (e.g. bizutage in French French, ontgroening (de-greenhorning) in Netherlandic Dutch), novatada in Spanish, from novato, meaning newcomer or rookie) or a combination of both, such as in the Finnish mopokaste (literally moped baptism, moped being the nickname for newcomers, stemming from the concept that they would be forced to drive a child's bicycle or tri-cycle). In Latvian, the word iesvtbas, which literally means in-blessings, is used, also standing for religious rites of passage, especially confirmation. In Swedish, the term used is nollning, literally zeroing. In Portugal, the term praxe, which literally means practice or habit, is used for initiation. In Brazil, it's called trote and is usually practiced at universities by older students (doutores and veteranos) against newcomers (caloiros) in the first week of their first semester. In the Italian military, instead, the term used was nonnismo, from nonno (literally grandfather), a jargon term used for the soldiers who had already served for most of their draft period. A similar equivalent term exists in the Russian military, where a hazing phenomenon knowing as Dedovshchina exists, meaning roughly grandfather or the slang term gramps (referring to the senior corps of soldiers in their final year of conscription).

The choice of word relies not only on regional variation, but also on social situation and level of formality (register) or social class. American manufacturers show an uneasiness with the word and its class attributes: American Standard, the largest firm, sells them as toilets, yet the higher priced products of the Kohler Company, often installed in more expensive housing, are sold as commodes or closets, words which also carry other meanings. Confusingly, products imported from Japan such as TOTO are referred to as toilets, even though they carry the cachet of higher cost and quality.

The Suda also stated that the term could be used of a daughter who had living sisters. Although the Suda indicates that in normal usage, the mother of the heiress was also dead, this is incorrect: whether or not the mother was alive had no bearing on the status of the epikleros.

This is a benefit in terms of keeping the costs of constructing toilets very low and allowing villagers to start building their own toilets immediately. However, it can produce two problems: first in flood plains or areas near water tables poorly constructed latrines are likely to contaminate the water table and thus represent little improvement. Second, long-term use of sanitation facilities is related to the pleasantness of the facilities, but dirty overflowing pits are unlikely to be utilised in the longer term. A related issue here is that CLTS does not address the issue of latrine emptying services or where they exist, how they dispose of waste. This has led some researchers to say that the success of CLTS is largely down to the cultural suitability of the way it is delivered and the degree to which supply-side constraints are addressed.",CAR_abfeb7a503e444ab7caf7d533bac121cdd9ce7ba,0," Garifuna is an Arawakan language spoken in Honduras, Belize, Guatemala and Nicaragua by the Garifuna people.

Dry toilets use no, or very little, water; they do not depend on flushing, and so do not produce Wastewater.

In some places, family members would sit on a straw mat in front of the toilet and eat a mouthful of rice, symbolising eating something that the god had left. A properly appointed toilet would be decorated and kept as clean as possible, as the toilet god was considered to be very beautiful. The state of the toilet was said to have an effect on the physical appearance of unborn children. Pregnant women asked the toilet god to give boys a high nose and dimples to girls. If the toilet was dirty, however, it was said to cause children to be born ugly and unhappy. According to a different Japanese tradition, the toilet god was said to be a blind man holding a spear in his hand.

The eighteenth-century euphemism was convenience; the term was further euphemised in the nineteenth century with the term night commode, which John Gloag suggested may have derived its significance from a design for a balance night stool in Thomas Sheraton's Cabinet Dictionary (London, 1803); Sheraton's design was made to have the appearance of a small commode standing upon legs; when it is used the seat part presses down to a proper height by the hand, and afterwards it rises by means of lead weights, hung to the seat, by lines passing over pulleys at each end, all which are enclosed in a case. This appears to be the link between commode as an elegant article of French furniture, and commode as a prosaic invalid toilet. Close stool, in turn, is itself a euphemism for toilet chair .

However, Brooke soon comes to find out that Sylvia is very opinionated and does not like Brooke's tastes, wants, and desires for her wedding, arguing with Brooke on almost every topic, from the bridesmaids dresses to the food to the photographer, and even Brooke's desire to design her own wedding dress. Once her company has officially been sold and she's no longer affiliated with Clothes Over Bros, she takes out her frustrations on Sylvia by saying she doesn't want her money or her input for the wedding and wants to do it her way with her budget, causing a rift between the two, though they later patch this up after Julian tells Brooke that Sylvia's only been acting how she has been acting because she is threatened by Brooke, since Sylvia was always the closest person in Julian's life before Brooke came along. After ruining most of the dishes she tries to cook for Thanksgiving dinner, she attends a large gathering at Nathan and Haley's for the holiday, where she's reunited with a fresh-out-of-prison Victoria, which Brooke is not pleased about at all, nor is she pleased that Victoria and Sylvia seem to be getting along great and bonding throughout the dinner. She later comes to find out that Sylvia was the one who found out about Victoria's release and invited her to dinner hoping that her and Brooke could fix things, but only did so to make Brooke happy, so Brooke tells her future mother-in-law that Julian is the man that he is because of Sylvia's influence and that's all the happiness she needs. After having a bad daydream of her wedding going horribly wrong due to how poor she's become and how bad it will be as a result, she realizes she has no inspiration whatsoever to continue re-planning her wedding now that she can no longer have the wedding of her dreams. While going through some old boxes looking for something to inspire her, she and Julian find the list of things Brooke always wanted to try but never did, which Millie created for her back in Season 6 and includes things such as skydiving, watching every James Bond movie, getting drunk at Octoberfest, learning to speak French, and more, so Julian helps her do almost everything on the list, and afterwards, he promises her that no matter what happens he will make sure that she will get to experience the final item left on her list, which is having a baby. As a huge storm is ripping through Tree Hill, Brooke and Julian argue over him suggesting they move to Los Angeles now that she no longer has her job in Tree Hill, which was one of her main reasons for staying. She accuses him of wanting her to lose her company so that they could move, and blows off steam by going for a drive despite the bad storm. Julian calls her and tells her to come home, and when she says she can't see the road well, he says he will come get her and she tells him where she is, but the call is then cut off when Brooke hits the brakes to avoid hitting someone standing in the middle of the road, which turns out to be Jamie's friend Chuck. She runs out of the car and asks him what happened, and he says there was an accident and points to a flipped SUV on the side of the bridge. She runs over to the car and finds Jamie, Madison, and Lauren, who's still unconscious. As Chuck and Madison wait in Brooke's car, Brooke helps Lauren out of the wreckage and tries to free Jamie as well, who's pinned down by his seatbelt. When Brooke realizes Chuck has a concussion and is having a hard time staying awake, she tells Lauren to use her car and take the kids to the hospital while she tries to free Jamie. Eventually Julian finds them, but right after he arrives, a speeding car dodges a downed powerline in the middle of the road and hits the back of the SUV, causing it to fall over the bridge and into the water with Brooke and Jamie still inside. Julian dives into the water and finds that now not only is Jamie trapped, but Brooke's leg is stuck underneath the steering wheel. Julian tells them the car is not sinking as the wheels are touching the bottom of the river, and the mood calms slightly until the levy breaks and water comes rushing into the car, and Julian is forced to save Jamie first while Brooke is still stuck inside, since Brooke tells him Jamie is just a child and needs help before she does. After getting Jamie out of the car and up to the road, Julian jumps back into the water and finds Brooke struggling to stay above the water, and by the time he frees her, she has lost consciousness and it seems as though she's drowned. He carries her up to the road and begins performing CPR on her, but she does not respond and he breaks down into tears thinking his fiance has died. However, Brooke's hand twitches and after a few more rounds of CPR she regains consciousness and coughs up water, and the ambulance arrives shortly after to take her to the hospital.

It evolved into its present form through contributions from various sources.  The Romans had toilets that conveyed away waste with running water.  In the 1590s, Englishman, Sir John Harington (15611612) contrived a crude flush toilet.

With the onset of the industrial revolution and related advances in technology, the flush toilet began to emerge into its modern form. A crucial advance in plumbing, was the S-trap, invented by the Scottish mechanic Alexander Cummings in 1775, and still in use today. This device uses the standing water to seal the outlet of the bowl, preventing the escape of foul air from the sewer. It was only in the mid-19th century, with growing levels of urbanisation and industrial prosperity, that the flush toilet became a widely used and marketed invention. This period coincided with the dramatic growth in the sewage system, especially in London, which made the flush toilet particularly attractive for health and sanitation reasons.",CAR_e5e2edf69fcc7262687f9dcfb90186b49475b8d3,0,

It first appeared in the fifteenth-century, borrowed from the Middle French term mythologie. The word mythology, (exposition of myths), comes from Middle French mythologie, from Late Latin mythologia, from Greek  mythologa (legendary lore, a telling of mythic legends; a legend, story, tale) from  mythos (myth) and - -logia (study). Both terms translated the subject of Latin author Fulgentius' fifth-century Mythologi, which was concerned with the explication of Greek and Roman stories about their gods, commonly referred to as classical mythology. Although Fulgentius' conflation with the contemporary African Saint Fulgentius is now questioned, the Mythologi explicitly treated its subject matter as allegories requiring interpretation and not as true events. (The word mythologa  appears in Plato, but was used as a general term for fiction or story-telling of any kind, combining mthos , narrative, fiction and -loga -, discourse, able to speak about.) From Lydgate until the seventeenth or eighteenth-century, mythology was similarly used to mean a moral, fable, allegory, or a parable. From its earliest use in reference to a collection of traditional stories or beliefs, mythology implied the falsehood of the stories being described. Although, with its remaining association with sacred tales of the Greeks and Romans, it came to be applied by analogy with similar bodies of traditional stories among other polytheistic cultures around the world. The Greek loanword mythos (pl. mythoi) and Latinate mythus (pl. mythi) both appeared in English before the first attestation of myth in 1830.",CAR_e7fbc6c3963f013defc48d4caa9a6d547a6fc453,0," pejorative term for a German (and, stereotypically, unattractive) woman is niemra, coming from a word Niemka (a woman of German nationality).

A squat toilet differs from a Western toilet in both construction and method of employment. A squat toilet essentially looks like a miniature urinal set horizontally into the floor. Most squat toilets in Japan are made of porcelain, although in some cases (as on trains) stainless steel is used instead. The user squats over the toilet, facing the hemispherical hood, i.e., the wall in the back of the toilet in the picture seen on the right. A shallow trough collects the waste, instead of a large water-filled bowl as in a Western toilet. All other fixtures, such as the water tank, piping, and flushing mechanism, may be identical to those of a Western toilet. Flushing causes water to push the waste matter from the trough into a collecting reservoir which is then emptied, with the waste carried off into the sewer system. The flush is often operated in the same manner as a Western toilet, though some have pull handles or pedals instead. Many Japanese toilets have two kinds of flush: small () and large (). The difference is in the amount of water used. The former is for urine (in Japanese, literally small excretion) and the latter for feces (large excretion). The lever is often pushed to the small setting to provide a continuous covering noise for privacy, as discussed below.",CAR_f1e6576ddb48ced08cd7c0dfef5d436c1f8d02a6,0," Shrinivas a.k.a.

He narrates to him the story. Rao also wants to do a film which will get a Nandi award as he wants to dedicate it to his father. In the opening scene in an apartment in Hyderabad, a girl commits suicide. The case appears to be serious and it is beinginvestigated by inspector Shravan (Shravan) who at first suspects the security, who was the first one to find about the suicide. The next day, the owner of the house (Ali) comes with a babaji who takes the spirit of the girl into a lemon but dies in a car accident on the way back. Then Sreenu tells Ramesh Rao about 3 months later. He also tells Ramesh Rao to imagine himself (Sreenu) in place of the hero.

The both of them become friends during the journey but the next morning, Anjali leaves without Sreenu knowing. After getting down the bus, Sreenu goes to his friend Madhunandan (Madhunandan), and now it is revealed that he had actually come to Hyderabad to meet producer Dil Raju and narrate to him a story he wrote. A house broker (Prudhviraj) gets them a house in the same flat where the suicide took place. After a lot of persuasion, Sreenu agrees to stay there. There he meets Athreya and Arudra (Satyam Rajesh and Shankar) who claim themselves to be assistants of Dil Raju although they are not and began to stay with Sreenu and Madhu. That night, the girl in the bus, Anjali comes there as she thought her friends who used to stay there were still there.

That night, The doorbell rings again but Sreenu does not open the door. Then next morning, he packs everything that belonged to him and runs away from the apartment. It is now revealed that whatever Sreenu told Ramesh Rao till now is his real-life story. Sreenu tells Rao that he just wanted to tell the story to somebody and he doesn't want to actually make it a movie. And saying so, he leaves from there. On the way back, Sreenu encounters a friend of Anjali whose photo he had seen in the room. When he inquires with the girl, he finds out that Anjali had a boyfriend, Madhunandan who was in jail as people believed him to be the reason Anjali committed suicide. At first, Sreenu thinks it is his friend, Madhu but later finds out it is not. Madhu takes Sreenu, Athreya and Arudra to his uncle Shaitan Raj (Brahmanandam), a psychiatrist. Raj helps the three of them and they find out it is just a man (Saptagiri) who has been hiding there as he thought he will get a free house if they also run away. The 4 of them encourage the man to work for a living. That night, Anjali comes there to tell them the truth. She reveals to them that her name is Ushanjali and the one who died is her twin sister, Geethanjali. Geethanjali was in love with Madhu, but her boss, who is surprisingly Ramesh Rao, rapes her after she disagrees to marry him. She commits suicide after he comes out and, Rao interprets as if she hanged herself to the fan, and has Madhu blamed for the death. The gang decide to take revenge on Rao. Sreenu tells Rao that he went back to the flat and the girl's spirit was coming that night to tell him who killed her. Ramesh Rao tells Sreenu he too will come along and hear the spirit. Sreenu and the gang send Ushanjali to Shaitan Raj to take training of the language and body language of devils so that she can act as Geethanjali. That night, at Sreenu's house, Ramesh Rao reveals he knows everything and that the spirit who has come now is not Geethanjali but Ushanjali. In a fit of rage, Ushanjali kills Ramesh Rao by beating him to death and then goes away. Just after she leaves, She comes back in again and tells them sorry for being late and that she is ready. It is now revealed that Ushanjali got locked inside her house after her door got jammed and that the one who came was the real Geethanjali (who escaped from the lemon after it broke open).

Computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued against this characterization. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet. Cerf would also later state: Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful.

Roman toilets, like the ones pictured here, are commonly thought to have been used in the sitting position. The Roman toilets were probably elevated to raise them above open sewers which were periodically flushed with flowing water, rather than elevated for sitting. Romans and Greeks also used chamber pots, which they brought to meals and drinking sessions. Johan J. Mattelaer said, Plinius has described how there were large receptacles in the streets of cities such as Rome and Pompeii into which chamber pots of urine were emptied. The urine was then collected by fullers. (Fulling was a vital step in Textile manufacture.)",CAR_ddcb6fc0ee3d7bf03bc04382e58c5d2dec2f872e,0," Although a precursor to the flush toilet system which is widely used nowadays was designed in 1596 by John Harington, such systems did not come into widespread use until the late nineteenth century. With the onset of the industrial revolution and related advances in technology, the flush toilet began to emerge into its modern form. A crucial advance in plumbing, was the S-trap, invented by the Scottish mechanic Alexander Cummings in 1775, and still in use today. This device uses the standing water to seal the outlet of the bowl, preventing the escape of foul air from the sewer. It was only in the mid-19th century, with growing levels of urbanisation and industrial prosperity, that the flush toilet became a widely used and marketed invention. This period coincided with the dramatic growth in the sewage system, especially in London, which made the flush toilet particularly attractive for health and sanitation reasons.",CAR_e5e2edf69fcc7262687f9dcfb90186b49475b8d3,0," The modern toilet in Japan, in English sometimes called Super Toilet, and commonly known in Japanese as  or as  is one of the most advanced types of toilet worldwide, showing a dazzling array of features.

The Oxford English Dictionary records toilet in English first, from 1540, as a term for a cloth used to wrap clothes in, then from 1662 (by John Evelyn) for a gold toilet service, and before 1700 for a range of related meanings (a towel, the cloth on a dressing-table, the act of using a dressing-table, and so on), but not for a lavatory, which did not come into use until the 19th century.",CAR_b8ba3ab17ce72affb6628db522d19f5a680d2c81,0,

Under Dave Stone, Brit-Cit was considerably fleshed out and there was much focus on institutional corruption; John Wagner, who originally created Brit-Cit, has ignored this in his Dredd stories and has the Justice Department as being more like Mega-City One's. When Dredd visited Brit-Cit in Doomsday, instead of the Star Chamber we saw a Chief Judge and a large governing body in an open assembly room. For the most part, this can be explained away as Dredd looking at Brit-Cit from a different angle to Armitage. When Brit-Cit Judges have been used by other writers (Regime Change by Gordon Rennie, Splashdown by Simon Spurrier), they tend to follow the Wagner model.

A small force of cavalry, and a few footmen and mercenaries of O'Ruairc's people, went to patrol the territory of Muinter-Maelmordha, for it had been reported to O'Ruairc that emissaries  of O'Raighilligh's people had collected to one place all the force that they found of Foreign and Gaeidhelic mercenaries, who had gone to make a circuit of Muinter-Maelmordha, and on a predatory expedition to Mac Fiachrach. As regards Muinter-Raighilligh, however, they encountered O'Ruairc's people at Farnacht; and when they saw each other's faces, Muinter-Raighilligh gave way, although they were three great battalions.

This day, however, was but a 'drop before a shower' to Muinter-Raighilligh, as then grew the beginning of succeeding tribulation and injury to them; for they despatched messengers at that time to the Foreigners, viz.:to Mac William Burk and to Mac Goisdelbh, with a view to devastating Connacht and the Breifne. As regards the Foreigners, moreover, they assembled a very great host, and proceeded to Ceis-Corainn, where they encamped, and where they remained the greater part of a week; and they plundered all the churches of the Corann.

With regard to Aedh O'Conchobhair, when he heard that Muinter-Raighilligh had arrived at the place, the resolution which he and O'Ruairc (who was at this time with him) adopted, was to leave their horses and armour at Cill-tSeisin, and to go themselves on foot eastwards across the Shannon, to make an attack on Muinter-Raighilligh; and they went by the passes, and sent routs and mercenaries on before them, to catch Muinter-Raighilligh, ut supra diximus.

These people came from northeast Mindanao. These people were responsible for the Anda petrographs which are one of the most important indigenous rock writing in the country. Around the 12th century, a group of people from Northern Mindanao settled in the straight between mainland Bohol and the island of Panglao. Those people came from a nation in northern Mindanao called Lutao (probably the animist kingdom of what will soon be the Islamic Lanao). According to the much credited book, those people established the Kingdom of Dapitan in western Bohol because the true indigenous people of Bohol in the Anda peninsula and nearby areas were not open to them, forcing them to establish settlement in the western part of the island. The kingdom was first built with hardwood on the soft seabed. It engaged it trade with nearby areas and some Chinese merchants. The Jesuit Alcina tales about a rich nation he called the 'Venice of the Visayas', pointing to the Kingdom of Dapitan at that time. The Jesuit also tells of a princess named Bugbung Hamusanum, whose beauty caused her suitor to raid parts of southern China to win her hand. By 1563, before the full Spanish colonization agenda came to Bohol, the Kingdom of Dapitan was at war with the Ternateans of the Moluccas (who were also raiding the Rajahnate of Butuan). At the time, Dapitan was ruled by two brothers named Dalisan and Pagbuaya. The Ternateans at the time were allied to the Portuguese. Dapitan was destroyed and King Dalisan was killed in battle. His brother, King Pagbuaya, together with his people fled back to Mindanao and established a new Dapitan in the northern coast of the Zamboanga peninsula. The new Dapitan eventually was subjugated by the Spanish. Pagbuaya's son, Manooc was among those who sided with the Spanish. He converted to Christianity and aided the Spaniards in the conquest of Islamic Manila and the Camarines area in Luzon. The people of Dapitan also assisted the Spanish in the conquest of Northern Mindanao. Eventually, the Dapitans took their vengeance against the Ternateans when Manooc's cousin, Laria, guided the Spanish in their invasion of the Moluccas (Ternate).",CAR_c64eb8243ad3d991e4dcc02666f3bf4e6ec1f06b,0," A number of Jewish rabbis who disagree with the initiation custom of brit milah, or circumcision of a male baby, instead have offered brit shalom, or a multi-part naming ceremony which eschews circumcision.

A squat toilet differs from a Western toilet in both construction and method of employment. A squat toilet essentially looks like a miniature urinal set horizontally into the floor. Most squat toilets in Japan are made of porcelain, although in some cases (as on trains) stainless steel is used instead. The user squats over the toilet, facing the hemispherical hood, i.e., the wall in the back of the toilet in the picture seen on the right. A shallow trough collects the waste, instead of a large water-filled bowl as in a Western toilet. All other fixtures, such as the water tank, piping, and flushing mechanism, may be identical to those of a Western toilet. Flushing causes water to push the waste matter from the trough into a collecting reservoir which is then emptied, with the waste carried off into the sewer system. The flush is often operated in the same manner as a Western toilet, though some have pull handles or pedals instead. Many Japanese toilets have two kinds of flush: small () and large ().

For the most part, early cities emptied their waste into rivers or seas manually or via open ditches.

Duple had used a similar idea on a special airmail van for the Royal Mail (famous as a Dinky Toy) a year or so before the Marshall's coach but were never to apply the style to a coach body. Another mid-1930s design to give coachbuilders a chance to be creative was the Maudslay SF40, with its set-back front axle and design for modern full-width bodywork. Burlingham produced a number of very flamboyant styles on this body. Like Duple, Burlingham were prepared to build to practically any outline the customer requested, and as a result in 1939 Duple were building (1936) Burlingham outline coaches on Bristol chassis for Black and White Motorways whilst Burlingham built to (1937) Duple outlines on Bedfords for Bournemouth Corporation in 1938 and 1939. Among trademark Burlingham features however were ornate shaped window frames and the use of decorative stained glass work, often used when toilet compartments were fitted to coaches but also used to illuminate the stairwells of the pre-war Blackpool centre-entrance double-deckers. From 19378 a revised coach style began to evolve with no canopy over the bonnet of half cabs and a near semi-circular window to the sliding forward entry door with the main applied decoration a slim curved side-flash, the whole coach curving gracefully in the idiom of the post-1936 Duple design, but being distinctively Burlingham in its sharper details, and especially in its rear aspect which was v-shaped in plan about the centre-line of the divided rear window.

One flush of a standard U.S. toilet requires more water than most individuals, and many families, in the world use for all their needs in an entire day.A homes toilet water sustainability can be improved in one of two ways: improving the current toilet or installing a more efficient toilet.  To improve the current toilet, one possible method is to put weighted plastic bottles in the toilet tank.  Also, there are inexpensive tank banks or float booster available for purchase.  A tank bank is a plastic bag to be filled with water and hung in the toilet tank. A float booster attaches underneath the float ball of pre-1986 three and a half gallon capacity toilets.  It allows these toilets to operate at the same valve and float setting but significantly reduces their water level, saving between one and one and a third gallons of water per flush.  A major waste of water in existing toilets is leaks.  A slow toilet leak is undetectable to the eye, but can waste hundreds of gallons each month.  One way to check this is to put food dye in the tank, and to see if the water in the toilet bowl turns the same color.

In upper-class homes, the first modern lavatories were washrooms with sinks located near the bedrooms; in lower-class homes, there was often only a collapsible tub for bathing. In Britain, there was long a prejudice against having the toilet located in the bathroom proper: in 1904, Hermann Muthesius noted that a lavatory i.e., toilet is practically never found in an English bathroom; indeed it is considered downright inadmissible to have one there.

Although outdoor bioaerosols cannot easily migrate into large buildings with complex ventilation systems, certain categories of outdoor bioaerosols (i.e., fungal spores) do serve as major sources for indoor bioaerosols in naturally ventilated buildings at specific periods of time (i.e., growing seasons for fungi).Major indoor sources for bioaerosols at residential homes include human occupants, pets, house dust, organic waste, as well as the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. Several studies have identified human activities as an important source for indoor bioaerosols. Human bodies can generate bioaerosols directly through activities like talking, sneezing, and coughing, while other residential activities (i.e., washing, flushing toilet, sweeping floor) can generate bioaerosols indirectly. Since microorganisms can accumulate and grow on dust particles, house dust is a potential source of bioaerosols. In a study by Wouters et al., they investigated the effects of indoor storage of organic household waste on microbial contamination among 99 households in the Netherlands in the summer of 1997, and indicated that increased microbial contaminant levels in homes are associated with indoor storage of separated organic waste, which might elevate the risk of bioaerosol-related respiratory symptoms in susceptible people. However, the analysis by Wouters et al. was based on the collected samples of settled house dust, which might not serve as a strong indicator for bioaerosols suspended in the air. Other materials in residential buildings, such as food stuffs, house plants, textiles, wood material and furniture stuffing can also become bioaerosol sources when water content is appropriate for microorganisms to grow.For non-residential buildings, some specific indoor environments, such as hospitals, wastewater treatment plants, composting facilities, certain biotechnical laboratories, have been revealed to have bioaerosol sources related to their particular environmental characteristics.",CAR_5eb2ac6fb05089158915b1e1e20e115e65249b4f,0," Originally, the term bath-room referred only to the room where the bathtub was located (usually a separate room not housing a toilet), but this connotation has changed in common North American usage.

Duple had used a similar idea on a special airmail van for the Royal Mail (famous as a Dinky Toy) a year or so before the Marshall's coach but were never to apply the style to a coach body. Another mid-1930s design to give coachbuilders a chance to be creative was the Maudslay SF40, with its set-back front axle and design for modern full-width bodywork. Burlingham produced a number of very flamboyant styles on this body. Like Duple, Burlingham were prepared to build to practically any outline the customer requested, and as a result in 1939 Duple were building (1936) Burlingham outline coaches on Bristol chassis for Black and White Motorways whilst Burlingham built to (1937) Duple outlines on Bedfords for Bournemouth Corporation in 1938 and 1939. Among trademark Burlingham features however were ornate shaped window frames and the use of decorative stained glass work, often used when toilet compartments were fitted to coaches but also used to illuminate the stairwells of the pre-war Blackpool centre-entrance double-deckers. From 19378 a revised coach style began to evolve with no canopy over the bonnet of half cabs and a near semi-circular window to the sliding forward entry door with the main applied decoration a slim curved side-flash, the whole coach curving gracefully in the idiom of the post-1936 Duple design, but being distinctively Burlingham in its sharper details, and especially in its rear aspect which was v-shaped in plan about the centre-line of the divided rear window.

Furthermore, when incorporated as part of CIWS, Type 349 is slaved to Type 730 CIWS gun and thus does not rotate, because the gun rotates when searchingtracking.

The waterways in these toilets are designed with slightly smaller diameters than a non-siphoning toilet, so that the waterway will naturally fill up with water, each time it is flushed, thus creating the siphon action. To flush the toilet the user activates a flushing mechanism (see above), which pours a large quantity of water quickly into the bowl. This creates a flow large enough to purge the bowl's waterway of all air, thus causing the bowl to empty rapidly due to the siphon action that has been created.

Those devils in the east of the state have less MHC diversity; 30% are of the same type as the tumour (type 1), and 24% are of type A. Seven of every ten devils in the east are of type A, D, G or 1, which are linked to DFTD; whereas only 55% of the western devils fall into these MHC categories. Of the 25 MHC types, 40% are exclusive to the western devils. Although the north-west population is less genetically diverse overall, it has higher MHC gene diversity, which allows them to mount an immune response to DFTD. According to this research, mixing the devils may increase the chance of disease. Of the fifteen different regions in Tasmania surveyed in this research, six were in the eastern half of the island.

For the most part, early cities emptied their waste into rivers or seas manually or via open ditches.

Type IB agents rely on metabolic enzymes, especially in hepatic cells, to bioactivate the prodrugs intracellularly to active drugs. Type II prodrugs are bioactivated extracelluarly, either in the milieu of GI fluids (Type IIA), within the systemic circulation andor other extracellular fluid compartments (Type IIB), or near therapeutic target tissuescells (Type IIC), relying on common enzymes such as esterases and phosphatases or target directed enzymes. Importantly, prodrugs can belong to multiple subtypes (i.e., Mixed-Type). A Mixed-Type prodrug is one that is bioactivated at multiple sites, either in parallel or sequential steps. For example, a prodrug, which is bioactivated concurrently in both target cells and metabolic tissues, could be designated as a Type IAIB prodrug (e.g., HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors and some chemotherapy agents; note the symbol    applied here). When a prodrug is bioactivated sequentially, for example initially in GI fluids then systemically within the target cells, it is designated as a Type IIA-IA prodrug (e.g., tenofovir disoproxil; note the symbol  -  applied here). Many antibody- virus- and gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapies (ADEPTs, VDEPTs, GDEPTs) and proposed nanoparticle- or nanocarrier-linked drugs can understandably be Sequential Mixed-Type prodrugs.

In 2003, Bauer argued that the earliest type species designation is valid, so the type species of Euprepis is Scincus agilis, a member of Mabuya as restricted by Mausfeld and others in 2002 (including only American species), making Euprepis a junior synonym of Mabuya.

All other fixtures, such as the water tank, piping, and flushing mechanism, may be identical to those of a Western toilet. Flushing causes water to push the waste matter from the trough into a collecting reservoir which is then emptied, with the waste carried off into the sewer system. The flush is often operated in the same manner as a Western toilet, though some have pull handles or pedals instead. Many Japanese toilets have two kinds of flush: small () and large (). The difference is in the amount of water used. The former is for urine (in Japanese, literally small excretion) and the latter for feces (large excretion).

From the wording of  31 I 1 UrhG (einzelne oder alle, which means: several or all) it can be inferred that each type of use shows distinctive characteristics.A type of use must, thus, be clearly distinguishable from any other type of use.  For each type of use there is consequently a corresponding right of use. If there are several types of use in connection with his work, there will be, in proportion, various rights of use the author can grant.

One main reason is that it takes some time for the customers to get used to the idea of a washlet. Sales in Japan were also slow when the device was introduced in 1980, but after some acclimatization, sales improved significantly starting in 1985. Around 1990, 10% of Japanese households had a washlet, and this number increased greatly to over 50% in 2002. Toto expects a corresponding improvement in foreign sales within the next few years. Another reason is the lack of a power supply near the toilet. While virtually all Japanese washrooms have an electric outlet behind the toilet, many foreign bathrooms do not have a nearby outlet. In Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the UK, and many other countries, high current electrical outlets installed in close proximity to water, or where persons may be wet, are prohibited by legally enforced codes due to health and safety reasons. Finally the outlet of the toilet (for S-type toilets) is max. 10  15 cm from back wall but Japanese toilets need it to be at least 30 cm so a S-type European toilet cannot be replaced easily with a Japanese toilet. They are also much more expensive than traditional Western toilets. Finally, in Europe, there is the competition of the traditional Western bidet; conversely, North Americans are not accustomed to any sort of bidet.",CAR_fb57b06de47890f64f26de0887d712b4514451ba,0,

In reality, the three radars are different and they can be easily distinguished by the following features: When electro-optics (EO) are integrated with radar, EO is installed on the portside of Type 347 radar antenna, but for Type 348 and Type 349, EO is installed on the starboard side of the radar antenna. Furthermore, when incorporated as part of CIWS, Type 349 is slaved to Type 730 CIWS gun and thus does not rotate, because the gun rotates when searchingtracking. In contrast, Type 348 is not slaved to the Type 76 37mm twin guns, but instead, installed separately from the gun mounts, and thus Type 348 rotates when searchingtracking. The shape of antenna is also an important visual cue to distinguish three radars. The tip of Type 349 radar is a conical, which is missing on Type 347. Instead, the tip of Type 347 radar antenna is a small circular flat surface, missing the tip of the cone. The antenna of Type 348 radar differs from both Type 347 and Type 349 radars in that most of the cone is missing, only the base remains, so the antenna of Type 348 radar has a very large circular flat surface, resulting in Type 348 radar resembles a scaled down version of another larger fire control radar for larger caliber guns (76 mm or greater), Type 344.",CAR_237599e070af0d7eed97dac6ccd6ba0f22761ae9,0,

Some other terms for these types of toilets are siphon jet, siphon wash, and in North America, wash down. All siphoning toilets incorporate an S shaped waterway. The waterways in these toilets are designed with slightly smaller diameters than a non-siphoning toilet, so that the waterway will naturally fill up with water, each time it is flushed, thus creating the siphon action. To flush the toilet the user activates a flushing mechanism (see above), which pours a large quantity of water quickly into the bowl. This creates a flow large enough to purge the bowl's waterway of all air, thus causing the bowl to empty rapidly due to the siphon action that has been created. This flow stops as soon as the water level in the bowl drops below the first bend of the siphon, allowing air to enter the S-pipe to break the column of liquid and to halt the siphonic action.",CAR_246d60fa2ffb92a5280206e9cea64ae180a92c6e,0," Seat disk toilet flappers can either be snap-on or threaded.

Historically, sanitation has been a concern from the earliest stages of human settlements. The Indus Valley Civilization is particularly notable for its extensive sanitation works, including private flush toilets. For the most part, early cities emptied their waste into rivers or seas manually or via open ditches. Sanitation in ancient Rome was notably advanced, as were some of the reredorters of medieval monasteries, but emptying of chamber pots into city streets continued into the modern era. A precursor to the modern flush toilet system was designed by John Harington in 1596 but did not become common until the late 19th century.

At around the same time, the Seven Society, a group so secret that its members are not made known until their death, appeared. The Seven Society established a new model for secret society operation on Grounds. While the ribbon societies were observed to draw their membership from the fraternities, and the IMPs and Zs from the ribbon societies, the Seven Society's extreme secrecy meant that the society had no apparent formal connections to the social secret societies.

In 1824 he published The Constitution of Friendly Societies upon Legal and Scientific Principles exemplified by the Rules and Tables of Calculations adopted ... for the Government of the Friendly Institute at Southwell (3rd edition, 1826); followed in 1825 by Tables showing the single and monthly contributions to be paid, the allowances to be granted, and the method of calculating, at every period of life, the value of assurances effected by members of Friendly Societies, together with a system of Bookkeeping recommended for the use of such institutions. In 1826 appeared his Observations upon the Report from the Select Committee of the House of Commons on the Laws respecting Friendly Societies, exemplifying and vindicating the principles of Life Assurance adopted in calculating the Southwell Tables, together with the heads of a Bill for improving the constitution and management of such institutions. The vindication was of Becher's contention that sick allowances could be calculated on a scientific basis, and that the Northampton tables of mortality afforded the best data for life assurance and cognate calculations, both of which positions had been contested before the committee by Mr. Finlaison, the actuary of the national debt. In 1828 Becher published The Anti-Pauper System, exemplifying the positive and practical good realised by the relievers and the relieved under the frugal, beneficent, and careful administration of the poor laws prevailing at Southwell and in the neighbouring district. The erection of a workhouse at Southwell, the substitution of indoor for outdoor relief, and the making the former as repulsive as possible to able-bodied paupers, had caused considerable reduction in the rates at Southwell, and the system in operation there had been copied with similar results in various parishes throughout the country. The select committee of the House of Commons on agriculture in its report pointed attention to the value of Becher's system, which was also favourably mentioned by the Quarterly Review. In 1834, during the official investigation which resulted in the new poor law, Becher issued a second edition of this work, with a new introduction. In 1837, he apparently converted, on at least one point, Finlaison, his former antagonist, and there appeared Rules of the Northampton Equitable Friendly Institution, and tables calculated from actual returns of sickness, old age, and death, by the Rev.

Additionally, because home insulation is improving, this can result in greater retention of indoor air pollutants, such as () .  With respect to geographic region, the prevalence of asthma has ranged from 2 to 20% with no clear indication as to whats driving the difference. This may be a result of the hygiene hypothesis or western lifestyle that captures the notions of homes that are well insulated and with fewer inhabitants.  Another study examined the relationship between nitrogen exposure in the home and respiratory symptoms  and found a statistically significant odds ratio of 2.23 (95% CI: 1.06, 4.72) among those with a medical diagnosis of asthma and gas stove exposure.",CAR_1daf34991f2b34b87ed4fda4d21a99f952ebe232,0,

Civil society played an important role in the promotion of democracy during the period of military dictatorships. However, more recently, civil society organizations have expanded and changed profoundly. While continuing to play an important role in the defense of human rights, in many countries civil society has become a vehicle for  political parties, individual politicians, unions and social movements to channel public funds for their own benefit andor political cooptation.",CAR_2009cd9ffef8c3ea5e437a59736a5b568216e789,0," The merger was announced in early October 1993. This time it was Riley who made the first move. Riley, recuperating at his Albany home after breaking his hip in a horse-riding accident in Wyoming, called Gillespie directly. The two quickly sketched out the deal. The banks were roughly the same size in assets and had very little geographic overlap, so it was touted as an out-of-market merger in which few branches would need to be sold off. It would create a $58 billion banking behemoth with a footprint that literally stretched from Portland, Maine to Portland, Oregon. Furthermore, the deal would plug many of the perceived holes for both partners.  The soft-spoken Gillespie was just 49 and Society had cultivated a deep bench of lieutenants. More importantly, Society had the computer systems and technology expertise to combine the two banks, along with capable tech boss Allen J. Gula. Riley also lamented the modest Albany International Airport, which lost service from several major airlines in the 1980s and complicated air travel for Key executives. Ohio also had lower state taxes than New York. Lastly, Society had recently built a 947-foot headquarters tower that was more commensurate with a major bank than the modest buildings used in Albany. These issues made Cleveland the preferable location for the new headquarters. Conversely, Key's brand was more recognizable.",CAR_205ac5a13c62aa71006d7b1b1d869cb2a03c3e41,0," Toilets accounted for almost 30% of residential indoor water use in the United States in 1999. One flush of a standard U.S. toilet requires more water than most individuals, and many families, in the world use for all their needs in an entire day.A homes toilet water sustainability can be improved in one of two ways: improving the current toilet or installing a more efficient toilet.  To improve the current toilet, one possible method is to put weighted plastic bottles in the toilet tank.  Also, there are inexpensive tank banks or float booster available for purchase.  A tank bank is a plastic bag to be filled with water and hung in the toilet tank. A float booster attaches underneath the float ball of pre-1986 three and a half gallon capacity toilets.  It allows these toilets to operate at the same valve and float setting but significantly reduces their water level, saving between one and one and a third gallons of water per flush.  A major waste of water in existing toilets is leaks.  A slow toilet leak is undetectable to the eye, but can waste hundreds of gallons each month.  One way to check this is to put food dye in the tank, and to see if the water in the toilet bowl turns the same color.  In the event of a leaky flapper, one can replace it with an adjustable toilet flapper, which allows self-adjustment of the amount of water per flush.",CAR_211a0a9aafa83682f475a80ae48345317e90a99e,0," There are strategies to prevent water infiltration due to humidity into structures, as well as ways to treat human occupancy practices regarding humidity. Vapor retarders are materials that can be used to restrain uncontrolled airflow and water vapor into an indoor space. Vapor retarders are used to decrease the rate and amount of water vapor diffusion through ceilings, walls, and floors caused by humidity. It is made of thin, flexible materials and its coatings can be installed by trowels or brushes. Utilizing vapor retarders in a building prevents structural dampness from occurring or continuing if it already exists. A strategy for reducing humidity levels in an indoor environment is by altering occupant activity and indoor mechanics. Kitchens and bathrooms need to have their own vents. Additionally, washing machines need to be vented outdoors. Both of these are important in order to decrease indoor moisture due to humidity caused by the activities occurring in these indoor spaces. Moisture sources, such as hot tubs or indoor swimming pools, should be covered by airtight lids when not in use, thus humidity levels stay low in the indoor environment.",CAR_212c4c566877faeb538e1e2563c9e1322ac04096,0," The right-wing Hindu women's organisation Rashtra Sevika Samiti considers Ahalya the symbol of Hindu woman's (and Hindu society's) rape by the outsider, especially British colonisers and Muslim invaders, but also Hindu men.

Opponents of Moelaert's proposal, argued that Kamloops needed a public indoor swimming pool, better facilities for its senior citizens and that they don't feel comfortable with animals being locked up in cages.  Moelaert would make it clear to the public that, The well-being of animals was as important to me as it was to my critics, and went further to explain, That a zoological park (The name wildlife park came into use later) could be a major recreational, educational and conservation project.  However, opposition to Moelaert's plan was still strong and support for his proposal was lukewarm as different questions were being asked on: How is he going to find a ?  Why not he start small with a few acres? How is he going to pay for it?  Moelaert would admit that he did not have all the answers and reminded the audience at the public meeting that his purpose for this meeting was to start the formation of a society so that they can gather information to answer those questions and to determine whether having a zoological park was even feasible.  Moelaert then asked for donations for the proposed society and received a $10 bill from Ralph Thomas, General Manager of the Kamloops Pulp Mill and received an additional $5 from Reg Waugh.

It is possible to have a toilet that uses no water.  A composting toilet treats human waste through composting and dehydration, producing a valuable soil additive.  These toilets feature a two-compartment bowl to separate urine from feces.  The urine can be collected or sold as fertilizer.  The feces can be dried and bagged or composted.

This design was much better accepted than Loos' earlier works and quickly became a worldwide example of rationalist architecture. In his buildings, Loos normally starts with one main volume in which the space, configuration, and elements follows the rules and composition of classical architecture. He organizes the interior of that volume with smaller cubes, rectangles boxes, and cylinders arranged in a volumetric puzzle of sorts. This determines the internal organization of his buildings and Loos regularly uses protrusions from the main block to create other areas of the building such as terraces. In the Steiner house, Loos uses his volumes to create a classical tripartite faade. He does this by creating a recess between the two wings of the house that continues straight to the roof. In general, Loos lets his fenestration be subdivided into squares and rectangles that all obey a modular system, which correspond perfectly with the geometry of the faade. This system sets up order on the interior such as the living room being connected to a terrace that has access to the garden. Even in this early design, Loos uses interior organization that would remain with him throughout his career.",CAR_2ef7403967be8514e4b9b73c14985ccf3a24032c,0," Later, Lalu tells Gilda, Alvin and Brittany a story about a sea serpent attacking a ship, when Simon comes in all wet.

First, some philosophers, notably Kant, argue that certain sorts of cognitive differences between human beings (or even all rational beings) are impossible, so such differences could never be found to obtain in fact, an argument that places a priori limits on what empirical inquiry could discover and on what versions of descriptive relativism could be true. Second, claims about actual differences between groups play a central role in some arguments for normative relativism (for example, arguments for normative ethical relativism often begin with claims that different groups in fact have different moral codes or ideals). Finally, the anthropologist's descriptive account of relativism helps to separate the fixed aspects of human nature from those that can vary, and so a descriptive claim that some important aspect of experience or thought does (or does not) vary across groups of human beings tells us something important about human nature and the human condition.",CAR_35a8577d3ff8916ad9882e2e1865e3fc69c6a152,0,

In the West, the study of Asia and Asian art became more professional as museums acquired curators to deepen and widen their collections and universities developed graduate programs. In China, the beleaguered Chinese government viewed traveling exhibitions which visited the West as a way to promote China's image, and Chinese art became an occasion for national pride. Loo's business reached its peak in the second half of the 1930s as he adapted to a more sophisticated market. Loo expanding his international art network to England, France, Germany, and America. Between 1933 and 1941 Loo launched at least one important exhibition or publication project every year. He continued to make major sales to his earlier museum clients, especially of bronzes and sculpture. Loo was instrumental in building the collections of the Nelson Gallery in Kansas City, whose organizer, Laurence Sickman, became a good friend. A series of catalogs and scholarly indexes displayed  Loo's knowledge and experience. Among his most successful exhibitions was Three Thousand Years of Chinese Jade, held in 1939 in New York as a fund raiser for China's wartime refugees. The war in China, however, made it nearly impossible to find or export artwork, especially the sculptures Loo so admired. Another problem for Loo was that many of his early clients either died or lost interest.",CAR_375c034be44431dec4ddbb00d9e5c1b667f53c56,0," Due to the dangerous, and potentially fatal, effects of the loo on vegetation, humans and animals,  it is sometimes referred to as an evil wind in popular Indo-Pakistani culture.

For example, the inside of the house is considered a clean area, whereas the outside of the house is considered unclean. To keep the two areas separated, shoes are taken off before entering the house so that the unclean shoes do not touch the clean area inside of the house. Historically, toilets were located outside of the house, and shoes were worn for a trip to the toilet. Nowadays, the toilet is almost always inside the home and hygienic conditions have improved significantly, but the toilet is still considered an unclean area. To minimize contact between the unclean toilet floor and the clean floor in the rest of the house, many private homes and also some public toilets have  in front of the toilet door that should be used when in the toilet and removed right after leaving the toilet.

One version of its origin has it that the Earl of Peterborough, supping one night with Rich in his private room, was so delighted with the steak Rich grilled him that he suggested a repetition of the meal the next week. Another version is that George Lambert, the scene-painter at the theatre, was often too busy to leave the theatre and contented himself with a beefsteak broiled upon the fire in the painting-room. His visitors so enjoyed sharing this dish that they set up the Sublime Society.  William and Robert Chambers, writing in 1869, favour the second version, noting that Peterborough was not one of the original members. A third version, favoured by  the historian of the society, Walter Arnold, is that the society was formed out of the regular dinners shared at the theatre by Rich and Lambert, consisting of hot steak dressed by Rich, accompanied by a bottle of old port from the tavern hard by. Whatever the details of its genesis, Rich and Lambert are listed as the first two of the society's twenty-four founding members. Women were not admitted.

A warrior was viewed by the people not as a maker of war but as a protector, provider, and leader. Warriors gained rank in Cheyenne society by performing and accumulating various acts of bravery in battle known as coups. The title of war chief could be earned by any warrior who performs enough of the specific coups required to become a war chief. Specific warrior societies developed among the Cheyenne as with other plains nations. Each society had selected leaders who would invite those that they saw worthy enough to their society lodge for initiation into the society. Often, societies would have minor rivalries; however, they might work together as a unit when warring with an enemy. Military societies played an important role in Cheyenne government. Society leaders were often in charge of organizing hunts and raids as well as ensuring proper discipline and the enforcement of laws within the nation. Each of the six distinct warrior societies of the Cheyenne would take turns assuming the leadership role within the nation. The four original military societies of the Cheyenne were the Swift Fox Society, Elk Horn Scrapper or Crooked Lance Society, Shield Society, and the Bowstring Men Society. The fifth society is split between the Crazy Dog Society and the famous Dog Soldiers. The sixth society is the Contrary Warrior Society, most notable for riding backwards into battle as a sign of bravery. All six societies and their various branches exist among the Southern and Northern Cheyenne Nations in present times.

However, some council houses were still being built with outdoor toilets, attached to the house, until well into the 1930s. Some of the earliest council houses did not feature an actual bathroom; the bath could often be found in the kitchen with a design which allowed it to double as a work surface. These new houses had two, three, four or five bedrooms, and generously sized back gardens intended for vegetable growing. At the best they were built at 12 houses per acre.

More technologically advanced societies have access to goods and services through newer media than less technologically advanced societies.In addition to this advertizing role, media is nowadays a tool to share knowledge all around the world. Analysing the evolution of medium within the society, Popkin  assesses the important role of media, by building connection between politics, culture and economic life and the society: for instance periodical newspaper has been an opportunity to first advertize and second to be up-to-date with current foreign affairs or the nation economic situation. In the mean time,  Willinsky  was promoting the role of modern technology as a way to come across cultural, gender, national barriers. He saw in internet an opportunity to establish a fair and equal system of knowledge: as internet may be accessible to anyone, any published information may be read and consulted by anyone. Therefore, internet is a sustainable solution to  overcome the gap between developed and developing countries as both will get a chance to learn from each other. Canagarajah  is addressing the issue of unbalanced relations between the North and South countries, asserting that Western countries tend to impose their own ideas on developing countries.Therefore, internet is way to re-establish balance, by for instance enhance publication of newspaper, academic journal from developing countries.

Indeed, in some traditional society, some gender cannot have access to a certain type of knowledge therefore respecting these customs limit the scope of dissemination but still allow the diffusion of knowledge.

Majority of the donated materials and services, mostly came from Kamloops, however, much of the donated materials also came from the Lower Mainland and as far away in Peterborough, Ontario.  With the donated materials and services available, founder John Moelaert would oversee the construction and became the project's first manager on June 1, 1966.  On that same day, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Staff Sgt. Gordon Simons succeeded John Moelaert as president of the society, since Moelaert was now in charge of managing construction.  The first item on Moelaert's development was to drill for an abundant supply of excellent water so that the zoo can have its own independent water supply.  On their first drilling attempt, Moelaert found what he was looking for  an abundant water supply, and soon after that, development and construction began.  After Moelaert discovered his independent water supply,  BC Hydro crews started to provide electricity to the zoo, by constructing underground services in order to avoid unsightly overhead lines.  Soon after BC Tel started installing the phone lines and roads were soon built.  Construction of the zoo would only take two months to complete, and it was officially opened to the public on August 16, 1966.  The first exhibits to be shown to the public was a  enclosure that featured two moose, Demitrius and his female companion, Gerda, and other enclosures that included the white-tailed deer, the fallow deer, and the Canada geese.  After operating its business under the Kamloops Zoo, the society would change its name to the Wildlife Park Society of British Columbia and rename the site as British Columbia Wildlife Park on November 1, 1966, in order to recognize the support that they have received from both the Thompson-Okanagan region and the Lower Mainland.  In its first 80 days of operation, the park drew in 7,000 people before it was closed to the public for the winter season.  A year later, on May 20, 1967, the children's zoo was officially opened by Phil Gaglardi in the presence of North Kamloops mayor Jack Chilton, alderman Gene Cavazzi representing Kamloops, society president, Gordon Simons, founder John Moeleart, and 500 spectators who attended the Victoria Day event.  After the event, the BC Wildlife Park received wide media attention from the Vancouver Sun and The Province, which caused provincial tour buses to include the park on their itinerary and school buses brought students for free visits coming from as far as Victoria to visit the park. A month later on June 8, 1967, visitors to the park witnessed the birth of a white-tail deer fawn, which was the first animal to be born at BC Wildlife Park.

Although outdoor bioaerosols cannot easily migrate into large buildings with complex ventilation systems, certain categories of outdoor bioaerosols (i.e., fungal spores) do serve as major sources for indoor bioaerosols in naturally ventilated buildings at specific periods of time (i.e., growing seasons for fungi).Major indoor sources for bioaerosols at residential homes include human occupants, pets, house dust, organic waste, as well as the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. Several studies have identified human activities as an important source for indoor bioaerosols. Human bodies can generate bioaerosols directly through activities like talking, sneezing, and coughing, while other residential activities (i.e., washing, flushing toilet, sweeping floor) can generate bioaerosols indirectly. Since microorganisms can accumulate and grow on dust particles, house dust is a potential source of bioaerosols. In a study by Wouters et al., they investigated the effects of indoor storage of organic household waste on microbial contamination among 99 households in the Netherlands in the summer of 1997, and indicated that increased microbial contaminant levels in homes are associated with indoor storage of separated organic waste, which might elevate the risk of bioaerosol-related respiratory symptoms in susceptible people. However, the analysis by Wouters et al. was based on the collected samples of settled house dust, which might not serve as a strong indicator for bioaerosols suspended in the air. Other materials in residential buildings, such as food stuffs, house plants, textiles, wood material and furniture stuffing can also become bioaerosol sources when water content is appropriate for microorganisms to grow.For non-residential buildings, some specific indoor environments, such as hospitals, wastewater treatment plants, composting facilities, certain biotechnical laboratories, have been revealed to have bioaerosol sources related to their particular environmental characteristics.",CAR_5eb2ac6fb05089158915b1e1e20e115e65249b4f,0," The most common technology used in ecosan systems is the urine-diverting dry toilet, but ecosan systems can also use other technologies, such as vacuum toilets coupled with biogas plants, constructed wetlands, composting toilets and so forth.",CAR_5f2c919e849d865c210d75f2f8a183252ae8f639,0," This also helps to explain why good hygiene is so important.

Weber framed the problem of evil as the dilemma that the good can suffer and the evil can prosper, which became more important as religion became more sophisticated. He identified two purposes of theodicy: to explain why good people suffer (a theodicy of suffering), and why people prosper (a theodicy of good fortune). A theodicy of good fortune seeks to justify the good fortune of people in society; Weber believed that those who are successful are not satisfied unless they can justify why they deserve to be successful.

Starting in the late Fifteenth century, European powers expanded beyond the European sub-continent to found colonies in the Americas, East Asia, South Asia, Australia and Oceania. This expansion has had a profound impact in terms of wealth creation in Europe and extraction elsewhere, cultural changes in most of the worlds societies, and biological phenomena such as the introduction of several infectious diseases into the Western Hemisphere, which caused tremendous disruption and population reduction for indigenous societies there. These events, far from occurring coincidentally, have had synergistic relationships, in one vivid example, the decimation of Amerindian populations through infectious disease often preceding and facilitating subsequent conquest by European powers. Such conquests in turn have often had significantly negative impacts on internal cohesion, ability of populations to attain adequate resources for their own subsistence and traditional social obligations, and local environments for colonized societies. In order to understand the effects of globalization on nutritional status and food security, it is important to understand the historical circumstances that have led to contemporary globalization, and that still manifest themselves in political, social, material, and physicalhealth differentials between (and within) the different peoples of the world today.The Rise of the Merchant, Industrialist, and Capital Controller, written by Richard Robbins in 2005, uses a hypothetical scenario of the reader as a merchant adventurer to detail economic world history starting in 1400. In 1400, China was arguably the most cosmopolitan and technologically complex society in the world. It was a center of trade, along with the Middle East, East Africa, and ports on the Mediterranean Sea. Western Europe, while playing a part in this network, did not dominate it by any means; one could argue for European marginalization in fact. This circumstance began to change when the Europeans discovered the Americas, setting in motion a process that would disrupt many societies and devastate indigenous populations of the Western Hemisphere. The dominant economic paradigm of this period was mercantilism, whereby European merchants began to achieve power in world markets and in relation to European governing aristocracies. Robbins cites example of government protections that facilitated mercantilism in the form of exclusive proprietary rights to trading companies and armies used to protect trade by force if necessary. He details instances of government protection such as the example of how Great Britain destroyed India's textile industry and turned that society into an importer of textiles is especially illustrative. In dealing with imperialism, capitalism, and the rise of corporations, Robins further details the manner in which the West transformed various regionspeoples from proactive participants on global trade networks into sources of raw materials and consumers of European or North American exports. This history of world trade is important to the consideration of current issues of disparity of power and wealth.There are many critiques the policies of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the promotion of high intensity capital investment in developing nations (e.g. Weller et al. 2001; Fort et al. 2004). Disparities within nations and growing poverty rates in many nations also provide compelling evidence of the idea that the rewards of economic globalization are uneven at best. There is a great deal of literature about globalization and increases in health disparities both between and within countries.Finally, there is Amartya Sen with Development as Freedom (1999); here Sen disagrees about whether or not the worlds poor are getting poorer, but also maintains that this criterion is not the most important. He argues that relative disparities and power differentials are the most important problems of globalization. Sen states that the increasing interconnection of the Worlds societies can have positive benefits, but that the disparities and opportunities for exploitation must be mitigated to the greatest extent possible, if they can not be eliminated outright. Sen provides groundwork for a nuanced middle ground between unabashed proponents and opponents of globalization. Far from being universally decried, the recent accelerated expansion of western capitalism, geographically, politically, and ideologically, has been lauded in many quarters. International and bilateral agencies such as the World Bank, IMF, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) have utilized free market capitalist theories extensively in development programs in many corners of the globe whose state aims are to promote economic growth for communities and nation-states and to alleviate poverty. Likewise prominent individuals such as former U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chair Alan Greenspan and U.S. based journalist Thomas Friedman have held forth extensively about the possibilities of economic and social improvement in developed and developing nations alike, mainly through increased access to appropriate education, sophisticated communications and transportation technology, and a paradigm of social and economic flexibility, where individuals and communities who can best adapt to rapid changes in the role of governments and the particular economic base of a given location would be in the best position to take advantage of the opportunities offered by economic, political, and cultural globalization. This free market ideology is also predominant in the policies and procedures of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and many transnational corporations (TNCs), most of which are headquartered in developed nations. The rise of Capitalism and the free market society have indeed increased and exacerbated food insecurity in the world's poor due to the structure and function of a Capitalist society where only those who can afford to buy food to feed themselves are the only ones with access to a secure and adequate food supply. Food is no longer a human right to life and health due to the Capitalist approach to commodifying food in the free market society that as a result of globalization has spread all over the world. Transnational corporations and trade organizations such as NAFTA facilitate this approach of commodifying our world's food supply by enforcing laws and regulations which further deepen the inequality of wealth and unequal distribution of common goods such as food between the rich and the poor.In contrast to the western economic model, most early social scholarship about economics  stressed the predominance of reciprocity as a primary driving force in traditional non-Western societies. Marcel Mauss referred to the gift as a total social phenomenon, fraught with ritual and socio political as well as material significance. Though some objects, such as armbands or shell necklaces in the kula ring that runs through several island groups off the coast of Papua New Guinea, might induce some form of prestige based competition, the terms of exchange are significantly different than a monetary transaction under a modern capitalist system. While Appadurai actually describes ritual objects as a type of commodity, he couches them as such under significantly different terms than the market-based types of commodity normally treated by economists. Annette Wiener criticizes earlier works in anthropology and sociology that depicted simple societies utilizing a simple version of reciprocity. Whatever the theoretical stance of social scholars on non-western traditional economies, there is a consensus that such essentials as food and water tended to be shared more freely than other types of goods or services. This dynamic tends to change with the introduction of a market-based economy into a society, with food coming to be increasingly treated as a commodity, rather than a social good or an essential component of health and survival.",CAR_b934cddf121985c404cbd14394489960e8f8ced3,0," In order to make sure that important and complex tasks are handled by qualified and motivated personnel, society offers incentives such as income and prestige.

After a very long march and few clashes with Indonesian police along the way, West Papuan students and local supporters arrived at the Taman Imbi Park in the heart of Jayapura.

One common characteristic new to these societies was the collective supervision of sexual behavior due to urbanization, and the growth of population and population density. Children would commonly witness parents having sex because many families shared the same sleeping quarters. Due to landownership, determination of children's paternity became important, and society and family life became patriarchal. These changes in sexual ideology were used to control female sexuality and to differentiate standards by gender. With these ideologies, sexual possessiveness and increases in jealousy emerged. With the domestication of animals, new opportunities for bestiality  arose. Males mostly performed these types of sexual acts and many societies acquired firm rules against it. These acts also explain the many depictions of half-human, half-animal mythical creatures, and the sports of gods and goddesses with animals. While retaining the precedents of earlier civilizations, each classical civilization established a somewhat distinctive approach to gender, artistic expression of sexual beauty, and to behaviors such as homosexuality. Some of these distinctions are portrayed in sex manuals, which were also common among civilizations in China, Greece, Rome, Persia, and India; each has its own sexual history.",CAR_baad53bf1c88c23ec0b3473500d81203155b2cd6,0," Loo was born in Los Angeles, California to Margaret and Longden Loo.

Three major factors that influence the most are indoor air pollution, contact lenses and gender differences. Field studies have found that the prevalence of objective eye signs is often significantly altered among office workers in comparisons with random samples of the general population.  These research results might indicate that indoor air pollution has played an important role in causing eye irritation. There are more and more people wearing contact lens now and dry eyes appear to be the most common complaint among contact lens wearers.  Although both contact lens wearers and spectacle wearers experience similar eye irritation symptoms, dryness, redness, and grittiness have been reported far more frequently among contact lens wearers and with greater severity than among spectacle wearers. Studies have shown that incidence of dry eyes increases with age. especially among women.  Tear film stability (e.g. break-up time) is significantly lower among women than among men. In addition, women have a higher blink frequency while reading. Several factors may contribute to gender differences. One is the use of eye make-up. Another reason could be that the women in the reported studies have done more VDU work than the men, including lower grade work. A third often-quoted explanation is related to the age-dependent decrease of tear secretion, particularly among women after 40 years of age.",CAR_c8bbf6f836f654780d913cfce8555dda8d8d3970,0," Under new structure, the BRCA consists of 9 clubs: Literary Club, Debating Society (DebSoc), Dramatics Club, Dance Club, Music Club, Photography and Films Club (PFC), Indoor Sports Club (ISC), Quizzing Club (QC), the Fine Arts and Crafts Club (FACC), in addition to the Society for the Promotion of Indian Classical Music And Culture Amongst Youth SPIC MACAY Delhi.

Throughout the book, she describes the factors that led to the inequality between male and female in the science field. In addition, she gave examples of different types of women in the society. An important idea brought up in the book was the private versus the public, where the private sphere is seen as the domain of women and public sphere as an area refers for men. Another important point she brought up was that the idea of including women in the fields of science does not mean that the sciences will adopt a more feminist view point. A simple increase in the number of women in a given field does not change the culture of that field. The construction of gender and science is a cycle in that ideas of gender are brought to the table already when practicing science and can inform what evidence people look for or areas they choose to study, and that whatever is found then influences theories of gender. The various contradictions shown through the achievements and silencing of women in science throughout history shows how nature and the society can influence gender and science. Schiebinger not only addresses the gender in the context of science, she also describes the feminism is changed through the history and culture. It is important to note that the book is written from a Western perspective and that the culture she discusses is that of the Western World, and in many cases, more specifically, the United States.",CAR_d539ce817e707541772e3e6cd706a16aade6a832,0,

A squat toilet differs from a Western toilet in both construction and method of employment. A squat toilet essentially looks like a miniature urinal set horizontally into the floor. Most squat toilets in Japan are made of porcelain, although in some cases (as on trains) stainless steel is used instead.

A shallow trough collects the waste, instead of a large water-filled bowl as in a Western toilet. All other fixtures, such as the water tank, piping, and flushing mechanism, may be identical to those of a Western toilet. Flushing causes water to push the waste matter from the trough into a collecting reservoir which is then emptied, with the waste carried off into the sewer system. The flush is often operated in the same manner as a Western toilet, though some have pull handles or pedals instead. Many Japanese toilets have two kinds of flush: small () and large ().

Horticultural societies are generally situated in semi-sedentary villages of a few hundred that clear a field and burn the cleared vegetation in order to use the ashes to nourish the soil (hence the phrase slash and burn). Next, the group plants a crop or crops in this clearing and uses it for cultivation for several years. At the end of this period, the entire village relocates and starts the process anew, leaving the old clearing fallow for a period of decades in order to allow regeneration through the regrowth of wild vegetation. These food items can be supplemented through the raising of livestock, hunting wild game, and in many cases with the gathering of wild plants (Miller 2005; Park 2006). Though periodic movement precludes absolute permanent ownership of land, some horticultural societies fiercely defend current territories and practice violence against neighboring groups. For instance, Napoleon Chagnon (1997) depicts the Yanamamo of Venezuela and Brazil as the Fierce People, though others have been highly critical of Chagnons account of this society. Horticulture can also produce a broad diet, and in some cases more food per unit of land area than foraging. Though populations of horticulturalists tend to have greater density than those of foragers, they are generally less dense than those which practice other modes of production. If practiced on a small scale, over a large area, with long fallow periods, horticulture has less negative environmental impact than agriculture or industrialism, but more than foraging (Miller 2005). Generally, horticulture coincides with a subsistence type of economy in terms of production, distribution.Pastoralism, defined as reliance on products from livestock coupled with a seasonal nomadic herding tradition, is similar to horticulture in that it is extensive in its use of land area. Social groups in pastoral societies tend to have similar numbers and population density to horticultural societies. Pastoral societies often trade animal products with agricultural societies for plant based foods to augment their diet. Frequent movement often means that pastoralism has a similar environmental impact to horticulture, though instances of overgrazing, and consequent land degradation (see later subsection under Globalization and Nutrition), have been sited in some cases. Pastoralism generally entails a greater reliance on meat or other animal products, such as milk or blood, than other modes of production. This mode of production has a similar use rights profile to shifting cultivation. Traditionally, pastoralism has coincided with a subsistence based economy, but in the last several decades, some pastoralist societies, such as Mongolia, have herded animals and practiced nomadic living patterns but have produced livestock primarily for market exchange.Agriculture, sometimes referred to as intensive agriculture, involves clearing and using the same plot of land for an extended period, sometimes several generations; it also involves the use of plows and draft animals in the preparation of land for planting and the cultivation of crops. Agriculture often supports much higher population densities than other modes of production (except industrialism) and agricultural societies can range in population from a few thousand into the millions. Though agriculture produces more food per unit of land area than the previously mentioned modes, the tendency of agricultural societies to focus on relatively few crops has often meant that these societies have much less diverse diets than foraging and horticultural societies. There is some archaeological and fossil evidence that populations in transition from foraging to agriculture have tended to suffer reduced stature, reduced musculature, and to exhibit other markers of malnutrition. Research has suggested that agriculture paradoxically allows a higher, but less healthy population for a given area. The advent of agriculture has marked that advent of social stratification in many parts of the world, with marked differentials in access to resources between segments of the same society. This mode of production also is more likely to entail permanent individual or family ownership of particular tracts of land than previously mentioned modes of production. Agriculture has co-occurred with both subsistence and market economies, often with a single society exhibiting some degree of both types of economies and has a more negative impact on the environment than the aforementioned modes of production.Industrialism combines agriculture with mechanized industrial production of goods through the use of fossil fuels. Additionally, industrial societies use mechanized equipment in order to prepare land for planting, harvest crops, and distribute food to locations distant from where the original crops were planted. Industrialism shows similar trends to agriculture in terms of population density, and environmental impact, except to a much greater degree. Dietary diversity can be highly variable under an industrial mode of production and can depend on access to foods produced for local subsistence on the one hand, or to income level and purchasing power visa vie foods available in food markets (Leatherman and Goodman 2005). Dietary diversity and nutritional health often correlate with the degree of social stratification within an industrial society and sometimes between societies. With the exception of Soviet model states, industrial societies are heavily based on the concept of private property rights and the accumulation of profit through free enterprise.The general trend for many societies over the past several millennia has been toward agriculture, and in the past two centuries, toward industrialism. Though these two modes of production are by no means superior to other modes in every respect, the fact that societies that practice them tend to have larger populations, higher population densities, and a more complex social structure has correlated with the geographic expansion of agricultural and industrial societies at the expense of societies emphasizing other modes of production. Concurrent with this trend toward intensified agricultural and industrial production has been the rise of the social and economic paradigm of capitalism, which entails the production and sale of goods and services in the market place in order to produce a profit. These trends have had profound implications for nutritional status for human beings on a global scale. In order to discern how broader economic and environmental trends affect a communitys food systems, food security, and nutritional status, it is important to summarize one of the most significant economic and ecological phenomena today, globalization. The next section will treat the linkages between economic and ideological trends over the last several centuries and environmental and political economic factors affecting access to food and nutritional status.",CAR_fb2f270d1945ebf723b13f11f5f8eff26e58d4c6,0,

In 1824 he published The Constitution of Friendly Societies upon Legal and Scientific Principles exemplified by the Rules and Tables of Calculations adopted ... for the Government of the Friendly Institute at Southwell (3rd edition, 1826); followed in 1825 by Tables showing the single and monthly contributions to be paid, the allowances to be granted, and the method of calculating, at every period of life, the value of assurances effected by members of Friendly Societies, together with a system of Bookkeeping recommended for the use of such institutions. In 1826 appeared his Observations upon the Report from the Select Committee of the House of Commons on the Laws respecting Friendly Societies, exemplifying and vindicating the principles of Life Assurance adopted in calculating the Southwell Tables, together with the heads of a Bill for improving the constitution and management of such institutions. The vindication was of Becher's contention that sick allowances could be calculated on a scientific basis, and that the Northampton tables of mortality afforded the best data for life assurance and cognate calculations, both of which positions had been contested before the committee by Mr. Finlaison, the actuary of the national debt. In 1828 Becher published The Anti-Pauper System, exemplifying the positive and practical good realised by the relievers and the relieved under the frugal, beneficent, and careful administration of the poor laws prevailing at Southwell and in the neighbouring district. The erection of a workhouse at Southwell, the substitution of indoor for outdoor relief, and the making the former as repulsive as possible to able-bodied paupers, had caused considerable reduction in the rates at Southwell, and the system in operation there had been copied with similar results in various parishes throughout the country. The select committee of the House of Commons on agriculture in its report pointed attention to the value of Becher's system, which was also favourably mentioned by the Quarterly Review.

The 3 factors they test are: 1. Are there at least 2 women in the film who have names? 2. Do those women talk to each other? 3. Do they talk to each other about something other than a man? (Sharma & Sender, 2014). Many roles that are given to women make them either dependent on the male counterpart or make their role more limited. Another characteristic of their role placement is that women are twice as likely to have a life-related role rather than a work-related role. Hollywood rarely chooses to have women be the all-powerful boss or to even have a successful career. There have been some examples that break this Norm such as The Proposal or I Don't Know How She Does It. Even in these 2 films the male counterpart is a strong role and in both the female lead is reliant on both actors for the storyline. Women do not stand on their own in movies and rarely are the center of attention without a male being there to steal the limelight. Some roles that have been portrayed in recent films have worked against this normative such as Katniss in Hunger Games and Furiosa in Mad Max: Fury Road. These roles break the norm which is definitely a step in the right direction. Typically women are portrayed as dependent on other characters, over-emotional, and confined to low status jobs when compared to enterprising and ambitious male characters (Bussey & Bandura, 1999). Women in cinema are grossly misrepresented and definitely under represented and it is up to us as a society to change that.",CAR_11723b2253541d008ae167f9b13ecbb1f146f1f1,0," The figure is actually a cardboard cutout standee of Jack, wearing a tuxedo and top hat, that was left on the set.

One flush of a standard U.S. toilet requires more water than most individuals, and many families, in the world use for all their needs in an entire day.A homes toilet water sustainability can be improved in one of two ways: improving the current toilet or installing a more efficient toilet.  To improve the current toilet, one possible method is to put weighted plastic bottles in the toilet tank.  Also, there are inexpensive tank banks or float booster available for purchase.  A tank bank is a plastic bag to be filled with water and hung in the toilet tank. A float booster attaches underneath the float ball of pre-1986 three and a half gallon capacity toilets.  It allows these toilets to operate at the same valve and float setting but significantly reduces their water level, saving between one and one and a third gallons of water per flush.  A major waste of water in existing toilets is leaks.  A slow toilet leak is undetectable to the eye, but can waste hundreds of gallons each month.  One way to check this is to put food dye in the tank, and to see if the water in the toilet bowl turns the same color.  In the event of a leaky flapper, one can replace it with an adjustable toilet flapper, which allows self-adjustment of the amount of water per flush.",CAR_211a0a9aafa83682f475a80ae48345317e90a99e,0," Troy Glasgow (born in Waterloo, London) attended The Brit school in 2001, graduating in 2003.

According to her co-stars, the director and producer, her work was noteworthy. Her scenes with Fredric March were said to be particular outstanding. The publicity prior to the film's completion indicated or predicted that her part would be one of the most brilliant in the production. When she attended the film's preview with her parents and friends, she was shocked to discover that all of her work had been cut from the film. The reason given was one of excessive footage.

The film won the Special Jury's Award at the Third Eye Asian Film Festival in Mumbai. She also played supporting roles in the comedy Mummy Punjabi, alongside Kirron Kher and My Friend Pinto, alongside Prateik Babbar and Kalki Koechlin. Her performance in the former received positive reviews, with the Daily Bhaskar branding her the only character that stands out and a firebrand. However, her performance in the latter was met with mixed reviews, with Rediff stating, Considering the oomph factor which Divya is capable of oozing on screen, it is one more opportunity lost as the all-pervading air is one of buffoonery, but with Jhinuk Sen calling her rather endearing. She played the female lead, Minnie, in the Dev Anand film Chargesheet, which was met with highly negative reviews.

Mork shows him a picture of him and his girl and Richie can not tell which one is Mork so Mork tells him that is the reason why Ork does not mess with clothes. Richie says that he needs a camera, some film, and more paper and pencils because he cannot do with finger as Mork can. Richie starts to go upstairs and Richie tells him to make himself comfortable and that he has the TV that he broke and Mork point his finger to it and it starts to work again with Richie telling him that he has food there but Mork starts eating the family's flowers (which he says needs salt) on the table instead. Joanie, Marion, and Howard come though the kitchen door taking about the movie they saw that and as soon as Joanie takes off her jacket all three of them notice Mork sitting on the couch eating the flowers and watching TV and Marion tells Mork that he must be a friend of Richard's and Howard introduces himself, Joaine and Marion (as Mrs. Cunningham) and Mork introduces himself and shakes Marion's hand. Marion says that Richie used to have suit like Mork's and Joanie says that they had feathers on it to which says that he likes feathers but he finds them fattening and Joaine called him another Ralph Malph (which is pretty ironic because when Mork came to the Cunningham's Richie though it was Ralph pulling a prank on him). Howard tells Mork to make himself comfortable and Mork puts his head on the couch with his butt in the air which the Cunningham's find weird and Howard says he is going to turn off the TV set but right when he is about to turn it off Mork points his finger at it and damages it. Howard tells Richard to come down to the living room because he does not believe what he is hearing and Richie comes downstairs and they start to ask where Mork came from and Howard starts to point his finger at him and all three of them (except for Richie) are frozen and cannot move. Richie asks why he did what he did and Mork says it was because Howard drew first (which means he pointed his finger at him first). Richie asks Mork if Howard, Joanie, and Marion are going to be okay and he says they will be all right because the effects wear off sometime with Mork putting down Howard's arm and saying that they do not have much time which makes Richie say he will make sandwiches for the trip. Richie ask Mork how long they will be gone and Mork says that they will be gone for 2,000 years and when Mork is not looking Richie makes a run for the kitchen door but Mork notices he is gone and tries to freeze him but instead he closes the door and the refrigerator door missing him chance. Back at Arnolds, Richie tells Fonzie in the men's room that there is a spaceman after him and Fonzie asks him what heand Richie says that it is because he is average and Fonzie replies with I told you. Richie tells Fonzie that this spaceman wants to take him in a spaceship and Fonzie makes a joke saying oh he wants to make sure you get a window seat which makes Richie grab a hold of his jacket and tells him that he is not joking around and Fonzie tells him he has a hold of his jacket and Richie asks him what he is supposed to do and Fonzie tells him to let go of his jacket. Fonzie goes to check out the spaceman Mork and the scene shows Chachi, Ralph, and Postie sing a song with Al smiling and watching them and Mork comes into Arnolds while Richie and Fonzie come out of the restroom and suddenly Mork points his finger and everybody is frozen (except for Richie and Fonzie) which makes Fonzie say Whoa! and runs back into the men's restroom. Three seconds later Fonzie comes out and Richie tells him about Mork's finger and Fonzie introduces himself and thinks he is challenging him to a fight which Fonzie accepts. Mork says if he wins Richie will go with him but if Fonzie wins he does not have to go so Mork tells Richie to count to three and the fight starts and Mork freezes The Fonz causing him to lose which means Richie will have to go with Mork but then just all hope is lost Richie sees Fonzie's thumb is moving just when He and Mork are about to leave Arnold's and Fonzie gets out of frozen position and Says Eyyy with both of his thumbs up. Mork and Fonzie put their thumbs together and a green light appears between the thumbs and Richie starts to write down what is going on then Mork points his finger to the jukebox and it turns on then Fonzie takes his head and bangs it against the jukebox and it turns off then Mork takes his finger and points it to the jukebox and turns it off then Fonzie who is leaning against the jukebox bangs his elbow on it and turn it off and the whole entire pattern is repeated until Richie tells them to stop and tells them that it is a draw and writes it down in his notebook. Mork kicks down the Ladies Room door and knocks it over then Fonzie bangs the wall and the Men's Bathroom door knocks down all the way down on the floor and Richie also writes this down in his notebook. Then Mork points his finger at Chachi and makes him walk around Arnolds like a robot and then he takes his hand and turns Ralph and only having his underwear on and him screaming and running out of Arnolds it is unknown what happened to Ralph. Then Fonzie snaps his fingers at a frozen waitress and they start to make out. then Mork tries it on a blond girl but instead makes Potsie walk to him like a robot and turns him away and gives Fonzie that one. Then Mork starts to do some target practice and makes owner Al walk around like a robot bumping his head into things then Fonzie starts to do the same exact thing to Al snapping his fingers and then making him walk into the kitchen and falling on the kitchen floor and Richie writes it down in his notebook while Fonzie leans against the booth. After Richie tells Mork if he gives up now Mork says he will put his fingers together and make the whole building collapse but then Fonzie stops him from doing that then Mork says a few people could be killed but that he has a force field around him that is able to protect him. Mork is about to knock down the building again when Fonzie stops him again and Mork asks him if he admits defeat and he says yes but is having trouble saying the word win and Richie says it for him. Richie says he will go in peace but instead he does not have to go but Mork is taking Fonzie then Fonzie is about to run when he is frozen by Mork then Mork and Fonzie must enter the time wrap and leave Arnolds and Richie yells to Mork to not take Fonzie only to find it was just all a dream. Howard wakes up Richie on the couch and Richie yells Don't't take him and Richie explains to Howard, Joanie, and Marion what happened and none of them believe them and he mentions the flying causer but Howard says it was just a weather balloon and then a man who Richie thinks is Mork from Ork is at the door is at the door asking for directions to somewhere.",CAR_26fcaa6c7ec6e71dfe527206a053be4f66d50eb9,0,

When Helen first mentioned the idea of the film, we decided to do a bit of research. There were a couple of books on the subject that were very useful and Helen knew a few people in the legal community whom we were able to talk to about the case. We then became convinced that this was a very interesting story that had divided the entire community in South Australia as well as the rest of the nation. It was an exciting story on which to base a film, not just a simple message film, but a story about how racism, the justice system and society at the time came into collision because of one man  Max Stuart.It certainly was a hideous crime, a particularly savage act, and we dont pretend otherwise. People still to this day have very opposed views of whether or not Max was guilty. In the film we dont say that he was, or that he wasnt. We show both sides of the story and its up to the audience to decide for themselves. But thats really not what the film is about. Max was the catalyst for changing so many peoples lives and its those people that this film focuses on. Its a real David and Goliath story about two young lawyers who changed police and judicial procedures  and by doing so were ostracized by Adelaide society.Robert was always our first choice for OSullivan. I really do think hes one of the best actors in the world today and as a director your ambition is always to work with the best people possible because they can bring the material alive. Robert Carlyle brings humanity to all his roles, as well as a great passion. He has an ability to inhabit his characters in the most critical way  and hes done it once again with OSullivan. He was perfect for the role.For the role of Devaney I could immediately see how Kerry could play the character as someone who could bring both a strength and a sense of humour to the role which we were very pleased with.Charles Dance captures Chamberlains qualities completely as someone who has both charm and a ruthlessness  an opponent to be reckoned with. His Englishness reflects the Adelaide establishment at the time which prided itself in being even more English than the English!David Ngoombujarra really was the only choice for us. Hes a wonderful actor, very intuitive and was totally committed and focused on the role. It was also important that we had an actor who could play the role with warmth so an audience could empathise with him. Its a challenge for an actor to play the role of a brutal murderer of a nine-year-old girl and still have the audiences attention and interest. David gives an extraordinary performance as Max.

Vikram revealed that changes between the two characters during filming took up to 45 minutes, with Abhishek Bachchan playing the tribal leader in the Hindi version whilst Prithviraj played the cop in the Tamil version, with Aishwarya Rai also in the cast. Vikram was initially apprehensive because both roles were to be shot almost simultaneously but revealed he succeeded by showing differences in his body language and expressions. Vikram revealed that he and Abhishek Bachchan played the roles in the respective versions without inspiration from one another.

Like cult films themselves, authenticity is an important aspect of their popularity.  Actors can become typecast as they become strongly associated with such iconic roles. Tim Curry, despite his acknowledged range as an actor, found casting difficult after he achieved fame in The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Even when discussing unrelated projects, interviewers frequently bring up the role, which causes him to tire of discussing it. Mary Woronov, known for her transgressive roles in cult films, eventually transitioned to mainstream films. She was expected to recreate the transgressive elements of her cult films within the confines of mainstream cinema.  Instead of the complex gender deconstructions of her Andy Warhol films, she became typecast as a lesbian or domineering woman. Sylvia Kristel, after starring in Emmanuelle (1974), found herself highly associated with the film and the sexual liberation of the 1970s.  Caught between the transgressive elements of her cult film and the mainstream appeal of soft-core pornography, she was unable to work in anything but exploitation films and Emmanuelle sequels.  Despite her immense popularity and cult following, she would rate only a footnote in most histories of European cinema if she was even mentioned.  Similarly, Chlo Sevigny has struggled with her reputation as a cult independent film star famous for her daring roles in transgressive films.  Cult films can also trap directors. Leonard Kastle, who directed The Honeymoon Killers (1969), never directed another film again.  Despite his cult following, which included Franois Truffaut, he was unable to find financing for any of his other screenplays.

It received wide critical acclaim as it went on to win three National Film Awards including the award for the Best Tamil Feature at the following year ceremony. A review from The Hindu noted that, Newcomer Rajinikanth is dignified and impressive. He followed that with Katha Sangama (1976), an experimental film made by Puttanna Kanagal in the new wave style. The film was a portmanteau of three short stories had Rajinikanth playing a small character in the last segment where he appears as a village ruffian who rapes a blind woman in the absence of her husband. His next release was Anthuleni Katha, a Telugu film directed by Balachander. A remake of his own Tamil film Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (1974), Balachander had Rajinikanth playing a pivotal role for the first time in his career.

He managed to find her in Kakheti and convinced to play in her first film, the 1923 adventure film Arsen the Bandit. The role of Nunu in the 1923 film Patricide and the role of Esma in the 1924 film Three Lives made her famous not only in the Georgian Union Republic, but all over the Soviet Union.

Anything that would make the audience think was worthwhile, although he turned down the role when it initially was offered to him. I wasn't worried about whether the character was a gay person or not; the reason I turned it down, frankly, is I read the script and I didn't think much happened in it. I just thought it was kind of tame. After  he discussed the script with Carol Rossen, who was to become his second wife, she responded, You're going to get on the phone and call Hollywood and tell them you want to do this part before they give it to somebody else, and Holbrook did just that. He felt an emotional connection to the character in the film because at the time he had separated from his first wife and he hadn't told his two young children about the split. It was very easy and natural for me to translate the emotional turmoil I personally was feeling into the turmoil Doug was feeling. The film remains important to him because it meant so much to so many people. That's a good reason for being an actor, when you can do something decent that touches people's hearts and their minds, so you feel like you actually accomplished something, he says.",CAR_3100d30ce85f8203866fe4e8bf1e291f544653f9,0," Later, Lalu tells Gilda, Alvin and Brittany a story about a sea serpent attacking a ship, when Simon comes in all wet.

For example, the inside of the house is considered a clean area, whereas the outside of the house is considered unclean. To keep the two areas separated, shoes are taken off before entering the house so that the unclean shoes do not touch the clean area inside of the house. Historically, toilets were located outside of the house, and shoes were worn for a trip to the toilet. Nowadays, the toilet is almost always inside the home and hygienic conditions have improved significantly, but the toilet is still considered an unclean area. To minimize contact between the unclean toilet floor and the clean floor in the rest of the house, many private homes and also some public toilets have  in front of the toilet door that should be used when in the toilet and removed right after leaving the toilet.

Prakash Upadhyaya of International Business Times reviewed the film giving it a 35 rating and called it A Pure Entertainer. He said the screenplay gets full marks and Prem Kumar reinstates that he is growing as an actor. Shwetha does her role neatly and impresses the audience as a sex worker and added that the music is a big disappointment. Writing for The Hindu, Muralidhara Khajane wrote, ... the director has made a humble attempt to peep into the life of a prostitute. Of the acting performances, he wrote, The role of Bhumika, a student of medicine, opting for prostitution, is too meek and unconvincing... Shweta looks convincing only when she attacks the male-dominated, chauvinistic society and rolls out dialogues exposing the hypocrisy of society. and added, Raghuram makes the hero Manu (Prem Kumar) an embodiment of all virtues and makes his character flawless. Actually, it is Vijaya Raghavendras character as Abhimanyu, which looks more realistic than Manu. Anu Prabhakar and Nakshtra have nothing much to offer. A. Sharadhaa of The New Indian Express reviewed the film and wrote, The film offers a grim portrayal of a sex worker's life through Fair & Lovely. The film reveals the cold hard truths that lurk in the life of a woman who exploits her body for financial gain. Of the lead pair's performances, she wrote, Prem has always been pleasant to see on screen and has faithfully followed the directors instructions. Shweta has tried to stick to the ground realities, without overdoing her act or her look.

We already have two scenes in biology: the first time they're in there and then the second time when they connect. For a film, when you condense, you don't want to keep going back to the same setting over and over. So that's not in there. The settings of certain conversations in the book were also changed to make the scenes more visually dynamic on-screen, such as Bella's revelation that she knows Edward is a vampirethis happens in a meadow in the film instead of in Edward's car as in the novel. A biology field trip scene is added to the film to condense the moments of Bella's frustration at trying to explain how Edward saved her from being crushed by a van.

Budd Boetticher summarises the view thus: What counts is what the heroine provokes, or rather what she represents. She is the one, or rather the love or fear she inspires in the hero, or else the concern he feels for her, who makes him act the way he does. In herself the woman has not the slightest importance. Laura Mulvey's germinal essay Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema (written in 1973 and published in 1975) expands on this conception of the passive role of women in cinema to argue that film provides visual pleasure through scopophilia and identification with the on-screen male actor. She asserts: In their traditional exhibitionist role women are simultaneously looked at and displayed, with their appearance coded for strong visual and erotic impact so that they can be said to connote to-be-looked-at-ness, and as a result contends that in film a woman is the bearer of meaning, not maker of meaning. Mulvey argues that Lacan's psychoanalytic theory is the key to understanding how film creates such a space for female sexual objectification and exploitation through the combination of the patriarchal order of society, and 'looking' in itself as a pleasurable act of voyeurism, as the cinema satisfies a primordial wish for pleasurable looking.",CAR_8f72c3bad92a38ec1e86a593d68f3762a7a96ba2,0," Laemmle entered films in 1925, as Carla Laemmle, in an uncredited role as a ballet dancer in the original silent film version of The Phantom of the Opera (1925) and later had a small role in the early talkie version of Dracula (1931).

The Tamil version, Neethane En Ponvasantham (2012) featured her alongside Jiiva, while Yeto Vellipoyindhi Manasu (2012) paired her opposite Nani. A further Hindi version titled Assi Nabbe Poorey Sau with Aditya Roy Kapoor was simultaneously shot with the other two films and was sixty percent completed, before Menon shelved the venture after his other Hindi film, Ekk Deewana Tha, had failed at the box office. The film spanned three periods in the life of a couple, focusing on their romantic relationship at school, college and in their late twenties. Samantha revealed that she knew Gautham would want to work with her again and immediately accepted the opportunity to portray the roles when she was offered the film. She felt that she could relate to the attributes and the circumstances the character goes through and described Nithya's character as close to her.

The Tamil and Telugu versions of the film opened in December 2012, earning differing reactions. Neethane En Ponvasantham earned mixed reviews and performed averagely at the box office, though Samantha received highly positive acclaim for her portrayal.

The Hindu wrote she goes a step further from her famous portrayal of Jessy (Ye Maaya Chesaave) and brings out the intricacy of her character well, while the Times of India wrote Samantha has the author backed role and she creams it. At the Filmfare Awards ceremony celebrating South Indian films of 2012, the actress subsequently won the Best Actress awards for both the Tamil and Telugu film industries for her performances in Neethane En Ponvasantham and Eega.

The state of the toilet was said to have an effect on the physical appearance of unborn children. Pregnant women asked the toilet god to give boys a high nose and dimples to girls. If the toilet was dirty, however, it was said to cause children to be born ugly and unhappy.

Budd Boetticher summarises the view thus: What counts is what the heroine provokes, or rather what she represents. She is the one, or rather the love or fear she inspires in the hero, or else the concern he feels for her, who makes him act the way he does. In herself the woman has not the slightest importance. Laura Mulvey's influential essay Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema (written in 1973 and published in 1975) expands on this conception to argue that in cinema women are typically depicted in a passive role that provides visual pleasure through scopophilia, and identification with the on-screen male actor. She asserts: In their traditional exhibitionist role women are simultaneously looked at and displayed, with their appearance coded for strong visual and erotic impact so that they can be said to connote to-be-looked-at-ness, and as a result contends that in film a woman is the bearer of meaning, not maker of meaning. Mulvey argues that the psychoanalytic theory of Jacques Lacan is the key to understanding how film creates such a space for female sexual objectification and exploitation through the combination of the patriarchal order of society, and 'looking' in itself as a pleasurable act of voyeurism, as the cinema satisfies a primordial wish for pleasurable looking.",CAR_d341e325e329d0d6b6d83288e26c046ee58f61cd,0," Benz appeared in Peacemakers, Coupling, NCIS, and Oliver Beene.

Experts claimed that films could link the fantasies of youth with the visual depiction on film because the lack of nationalistic culture in society.

Discussions of the Blaxploitation films include, assumptions about the relation of an African American spectatorship to Hollywood in general often rely on the notion that Black spectatorship is either degraded, infantile, or polluted by the outside forces to which it is subjugated. Blaxploitation films provided a counter narrative to the idea of white supremacy and the traditional portrayals of African Americans in the Hollywood cinema. The Blaxploitation narrative of ghetto despair illustrated African Americans response to the Black Power era. In addition, Blaxploitation films provided and developed the concept of masculinity, which was lacking in Hollywood films. Hollywood films had wide- ranging view of males from the placid, asexual Sidney Poitier model to the plantation Sambo or the comical Steppin Fetchit. Blaxploitation films depiction of the destructive inner- city lives of African Americans and the hyper masculine male character both countered and enforced the growing urban African American criminality of the 1960s. The release of the movie Shaft (1971) featured an African American detective who used his Harlem street smarts to help him win a war wagged against a street mob. The director, Gordon Parks characterized an African American as the lead, authoritative role. He also employed many African Americans to help with the film, giving them positions from the screenwriter to casting them as extras in the film. The inclusion of African Americans in the film and during the filmmaking process added a more realistic urban feel. Including African American in filmmaking made a notable impact and set the precedent for future directors. The genre of Blaxploitation affected Hollywoods vision of African Americans as well as the existing political hierarchy in which they were placed in the United States. The increase in Blaxploitation films generally established and defined African Americans in the post-civil rights ear in the United States. ",CAR_e1533945f6659d3c1fc311cbb0dff6fb5ecdb1f7,0,

The Toto product Washlet Zoe is listed in Guinness World Records as the world's most sophisticated toilet with seven functions. However, as the model was introduced in 1997, it is now likely to be inferior to the latest model by Toto, Neorest.

Before making his start in films, Rivero studied to become a Shakespearean actor with the famous stage actor Robert B. Mantell.  His first appearance was in a small role in the 1923 film, The Bright Shawl, which was produced by Inspiration Pictures, and east coast film company, and was shot in Cuba. His first featured role was in the 1921 western, Fast and Fearless, which starred Jay Wilsey (known by his stage name as Buffalo Bill, Jr.) and Jean Arthur. He entered sound films in 1930 in the Spanish language films As es la vida and El presidio (the Spanish version of The Big House. During the early 1930s, while Hollywood was still making versions of films in different languages, Rivero continued to be cast in Spanish language films, his final one being 1934's Nada ms que una mujer, the Spanish version of Pursued. His first sound film in English was God's Country and the Man (1931), written and directed by J.P. McCarthy. During the 1930s and 1940s many of his roles were in westerns.  Some of his more notable films during those decades include: the 1932 drama, Winner Take All, starring James Cagney; a small role in the 1935 biopic Diamond Jim, starring Edward Arnold and Jean Arthur; the role of Santa Anna in the 1937 historical drama Heroes of the Alamo; he had a small role in Betty Grable's first starring vehicle, Down Argentine Way (1940); he appeared in the bullfighting film, Blood and Sand (1941), starring Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell; he had another small role in the 1942 remake of Rio Rita, starring Abbott and Costello; he played one of the Spanish officials in the Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn vehicle, Woman of the Year (1942); he played one of the monks in The Song of Bernadette, starring Jennifer Jones; he played a waiter in final American film of Laurel and Hardy, 1945's The Bullfighters; he played a government clerk in Anna and the King of Siam, starring Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison; as a manservant in the Bob Hope and Bing Crosby road picture, Road to Rio (1947); and the barber in John Huston's classic western, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), starring Humphrey Bogart.",CAR_0a2cbe5942b56c42fb56f5033eb2775ad3af3d78,0," The traditional Japanese-style (, washiki) toilet is a squat toiletalso known as the 'Asian Toilet,' as squat toilets of somewhat similar design are common all over Asia. A squat toilet differs from a Western toilet in both construction and method of employment. A squat toilet essentially looks like a miniature urinal set horizontally into the floor. Most squat toilets in Japan are made of porcelain, although in some cases (as on trains) stainless steel is used instead. The user squats over the toilet, facing the hemispherical hood, i.e., the wall in the back of the toilet in the picture seen on the right. A shallow trough collects the waste, instead of a large water-filled bowl as in a Western toilet. All other fixtures, such as the water tank, piping, and flushing mechanism, may be identical to those of a Western toilet. Flushing causes water to push the waste matter from the trough into a collecting reservoir which is then emptied, with the waste carried off into the sewer system. The flush is often operated in the same manner as a Western toilet, though some have pull handles or pedals instead. Many Japanese toilets have two kinds of flush: small () and large (). The difference is in the amount of water used. The former is for urine (in Japanese, literally small excretion) and the latter for feces (large excretion). The lever is often pushed to the small setting to provide a continuous covering noise for privacy, as discussed below.",CAR_f1e6576ddb48ced08cd7c0dfef5d436c1f8d02a6,0," In the 1960s and 1970s, feminists such as Clare Short, Gaye Tuchman, and Angela McRobbie denounced unfair representations of gender in media and especially in magazines. Germaine Greer, Australian-born author of The Female Eunuch (1970), offered a systematic deconstruction of ideas such as womanhood and femininity, arguing that women are forced to assume submissive roles in society to fulfill male fantasies of what being a woman entails.  Greer wrote that women were perceived as mere consumers benefiting from the purchasing power of their husband. Women become targets for marketing, she said, and their image is used in advertising to sell products.  American socialist writer and feminist, Sharon Smith wrote on the first issue of Women and Film that women's roles in film almost always revolve around her physical attraction and the mating games she plays with the male characters in contrast to men's roles, which according to the author are more varied. In 1973 Marjorie Rosen, an important contributor to feminist film theory, argued that the Cinema Woman is a Popcorn Venus, a delectable but insubstantial hybrid of cultural distortions. In 1978 Gaye Tuchman wrote of the concept of symbolic annihilation, blaming the media for imposing a negative vision of active women and making an apologia for housewives. She feared that stereotypes would discourage young women from professional ambitions, which are essential for the American economy.",CAR_f4744857cfc176854d1124663be2daf51aed6b7e,0," Mainly outside the commercial sector, film makers from the new commonwealth countries had begun to emerge during the 1970s.

Police (e.g. in Los Angeles) have sometimes supported their privatization, claiming that public toilets are crime scenes that attract illegal activity. A criticism of toilet privatization is that it results in the denial of a basic service to the urban poor. In some cases, partial privatization of the toilet system takes place in the form of vendors supplying the service in exchange for advertising rights. Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg described such a deal as a unique opportunity to...create a vibrant and aesthetically pleasing streetscapewithout the burden of public investment. In southern California in the 1980s, authorities consciously reduced the number of public toilets to make certain areas less attractive to undesirables.

So typically when it comes to black characters, either you have to be a successful, smart business person, or you're hip, but you're never both, said Hudlin. And one of the reasons why the movie has had such enduring popularity is because the character is both. He's much more in the Cary Grant mode of business person. While working on the characterization of the main character, Hudlin came up with the foot gag, which was used as a plot device to show the arc of the character's growth. It originated from a joke between the director and his friends about a man who's so picky about women that he even looks at their back teeth. So it's like, how do we define that Eddie's a back teeth kind of guy? So I came upon the idea of showing feet. That no matter how beautiful this woman is, if she has messed up feet, he's out of there. Also, Hudlin said that we know he's evolved into a higher level of consciousness when he doesn't even notice what Halle Berry's feet look like.

The 3 factors they test are: 1. Are there at least 2 women in the film who have names? 2. Do those women talk to each other? 3. Do they talk to each other about something other than a man? (Sharma & Sender, 2014). Many roles that are given to women make them either dependent on the male counterpart or make their role more limited. Another characteristic of their role placement is that women are twice as likely to have a life-related role rather than a work-related role. Hollywood rarely chooses to have women be the all-powerful boss or to even have a successful career. There have been some examples that break this Norm such as The Proposal or I Don't Know How She Does It. Even in these 2 films the male counterpart is a strong role and in both the female lead is reliant on both actors for the storyline. Women do not stand on their own in movies and rarely are the center of attention without a male being there to steal the limelight. Some roles that have been portrayed in recent films have worked against this normative such as Katniss in Hunger Games and Furiosa in Mad Max: Fury Road. These roles break the norm which is definitely a step in the right direction. Typically women are portrayed as dependent on other characters, over-emotional, and confined to low status jobs when compared to enterprising and ambitious male characters (Bussey & Bandura, 1999). Women in cinema are grossly misrepresented and definitely under represented and it is up to us as a society to change that.",CAR_11723b2253541d008ae167f9b13ecbb1f146f1f1,0," In the plumbing world, most toilets are one of two sizes: standard and elongated. A standard size toilet, also referred to as round, has historically been the most common in American homes. However, the elongated size toilet, sometimes called oblong, is often installed in homes being built today thanks to its more luxurious larger size. To determine which size toilet you have, and thus which size toilet seat will fit your toilet, grab a measuring tape. Measure the length of the toilet bowl from the hinge post holes to the front rim. If the length is about 16-17 inches, a standard round toilet seat will fit your toilet. If the length is 18-19 inches, an elongatedoblong toilet seat will fit. Both toilet seat sizes have a width of about 14.5 inches, and in the United States, the distance between the hinge post holes is about 5.5 inches.
