The book itself was dedicated to the Duchess, with an image of her as the frontispiece. The Duchess was involved in the breeding of several different dog breeds, including Borzois, Fox Terriers (both Smooth and Wire), Whippets, Scottish Deerhounds and Clumber Spaniels; the breed named after the ancestral home of the Dukes of Newcastle.

This shift away from neuropsychological research also marked a shift in his publishing strategy, away from single study publications in research journals, to publication of his new data as part of material presented in book form. Many of his books on dogs do contain hithertofore unpublished empirical data. For example, his book The Intelligence of Dogs is based on a survey sent to all of the dog obedience judges in the United States and Canada, and resulted in the ranking of 110 dog breeds by intelligence. This ranking caused a rather large media stir. His book Why we love the dogs we do looks at the personality of people and how the owner's personality predicts their relationship with various dog breeds. It is based on a survey of more than 6000 people who took a personality test and reported on their experiences with the various dogs that they have owned. This book proved to be very popular and Coren's personality test is now used by some dog shelters to determine whether prospective owners are suitable for a particular breed of dog. Similarly, his book Why does my dog act that way? uses data from approximately a thousand dogs to determine features of the personality of various dog breeds. However other books that he has written on dog behavior have provided less formal data presentation and in these his creative contribution is based on the organization and interpretation of the research of others, as is the case in How to speak dog. These books have also been well accepted and have been proven to be very popular.Overall, it is probably true that for scientific audiences Coren is best known for his neuropsychological contributions while for the general public he is best known for his writing and research concerning dogs, dog behavior, and the relationship between dogs and people.",CAR_1d9404ba9ade6b0d016b3c4b50943da4d0b9d12a,0,,

It is believed the Ibizan Hound evolves from the tesem, the ancient Egyptian hunting dog. Representations of this dog on the walls of ancient tombs show a striking similarity to the modern Ibizan Hound. These dogs would have been brought to the island of Eivissa by the Phoenicians, who founded settlements there as early as the 8th century BC. A recent DNA analysis did not find support for this opinion and did not include the Ibizan Hound among their identified ancient dog breeds. A more recent article argues that continued trait selective breeding may be behind this lack of support. Heidi G. Parker, the lead author of the original study has stated recently that indeed their original findings do not imply that the Ibizan Hound is not an ancient breed and that with better tools they would in all likelihood be able to trace a continuous lineage of thousands of years for many dog breeds and add them to their group of ancient dogs.",CAR_2a0ca814e3643c9ffdfaeb6b5f02f11e889c7db4,0,,

3,45_1,45,1," <span>What dog breed is the best for playing?</span>",HIT number 4 of 44 for question 1,false," This is a versatile dog with excellent sense of smell, hearing and vision, strong hunting drive, endurance; they are aggressive to predators and soft and gentle to humans. They are multi-purpose, have got excellent sense of smell, absolute pitch and good eyesight. They are tireless and with good anger towards predators. At the same time, theyve got kind character and are very faithful to people. Yakutian Laikas are not demanding to conditions of life and easily endure the hostile climate of northern Siberia. In harsh Siberian conditions they reveal their stamina; they tend to work in small groups and can work through the whole day, from dawn to sunset. Popularity of dog sledding appeared with the arrival of Russian traders to the Arctic. With the increased demand for white polar foxes in the 17th century, the Arctic exploration received its spike. Furs and mammoth tusks trade became local nations main income. Origin and subsequent formation of the breed are still not quite known, but because of the hard to access country and extreme natural conditions, Yakutian Laikas have lived as primitive aboriginal breeds; they were rarely confined and mated free. Naturally, local type dogs could be preserved only under conditions of complete isolation from dogs of other breeds. First scientific descriptions of dogs of Yakutia were published in late 18th century, when first geographic studies of the north were conducted. Prince Shirinsky-Shikhmatov wrote in his monograph about Laikas: Researchers of the north, of course, could not overlook northern dog; they could not disagree with hard fact that presence of this dog makes life of northern people possible. It is even more strange that so little attention was paid to description of dogs of the north; their ancestral aboriginal type and numerous varieties remain obscure. There are as many types of Laikas as ethnic minorities of the north; varieties of Laikas differ clearly from each other, each has its own peculiarities and their division is indisputable. This monograph was written in 1898. Russian Geographic Society gave task to Mr. Maak to investigate Vilyuisk District. Review of Vilyuiks District of Yakutian Provionce was published in 1877. Maak wrote: I saw dog of very typical appearance and very common in Siberia, which was fox-like. In 1896, V. L. Seroshevsky published a book Yakuts, edited by N. I. Veselovsky. Describing dogs of Yakuts, Seroshevsky divides them into two groups, 1) guarding and hunting dogs and 2) maritime sled dogs. He wrote: even most poor Yakut having no other animals, has at least one dog. Yokhelson (Johelson?), 1898, in his publication Hunting Industry in Kolyma Territory of Yakutian Province and described the Tungus Lajka used for sledding and hunting dogs. He wrote: There are two breeds of dogs, one is so-called Tungus Laika, a pointed-eared dog of nomadic reindeer herders and polar sled dog. All researchers described dogs of Yakutia as one breed of polar sled dogs. Yokhelson wrote: Sled dog is a burden animal not only of nomads living in not forested country, but also of settled near the river Russians and russified minorities and the dog of majority of cattle keeping Yakuts. Except southwestern part of the territory, one can find 5-6 dogs in every yurta, which are used for hauling firewood and other works needed by the household. The polar dog is not big, 50-60 cm at the shoulder In the appearance, with his prick ears, oblique set eyes, thick coat and broad massive head, pointed muzzle, low carried tail (when the dog is tired, eats or in a bad mood), the dog is very similar to wolf. Among them, there are shaggy dogs, and somewhat blunt muzzle not different from our Spitzes  Generally, type of Kolyma sled dog is diverse and, perhaps, it is a mix between Kamchatka and Eskimo sled dogs with another imported breed. It stands to a reason that other dogs relocated here together with new immigrants. Both Seroshevsky and Yokhelson described the Yakutian Sled Dog similarly: Legs relatively thick and short, chest, which is used to pull sleds, perfectly developed; neck is thick and short. Face is unusually intelligent and with melancholic or grim expression. In principle, it remains so today and the dogs little changed with the spreading civilization in the Yakutian north.",CAR_3542fa20c51ca2de096a71df6a466960f665c6a9,0,"  (a type of dog, not an actual species), found what he believed were some examples of similar dogs in the Austrian countryside. In 1921 he began serious breeding to revive and define the type of the breed, to separate them from other landrace pinschers of the area. The Austrian Kennel Club (sterreicher Kynologenverband) first recognised the breed as the sterreichischer Kurzhaarpinscher (translates in English as Austrian Shorthaired Pinscher) in 1928. The name was given to the breed to identify its place of origin as Austria (sterreich), and to differentiate it from the Schnauzer which at that time was called the Rough-haired Pinscher (rauhaariger Pinscher). After World War II, though, the breed almost vanished. In the 1970s only one registered dog of the breed remained, named Diokles of Angern. Breeding this dog with other dogs identified as of the old pinscher type in the area (Landpinschern) has brought the breed back, although there are still only a small number of them.",CAR_36fa0b912516e6159829b6da668ac4a21ab8c4d9,0," The chizer mixes the highly active personality of a miniature schnauzer with the big, bold attitude of a Chihuahua, making them sturdy and seemingly tough dogs. However, the chizer is a fiercely loyal companion to its owner, and is protective of their owner. Chizers are seen as sweet, gentle, loving dogs, which tend to be great lap dogs for their owners, and tend to shower affection upon their owners with cuddling lots and many kisses. It is a generally playful breed, and will play for a long time before tiring out and eventually taking a nap. This breed needs daily walks, and constant activity time in order to keep the breed on its best behaviour. The chizer is a good breed for single people or families without children, as it takes serious socialization towards children for the chizer to be comfortable. This breed has be known to nip at small children, and will not take kindly to any children forcefully playing with it. The chizer is a breed that is generally fairly shy, and tends to be scared when meeting new people or other dogs, and again socialization at a young age can alleviate this issue. The chizer is an extremely intelligent dog, and are easy to train due to their intelligence. However, they need a good amount of training to prevent from nipping, and chewing; as they are a breed that loves to chew anything they can find. They have the ability to pick up things very fast, and learn all sorts of commands.  However, it is tough to train the chizer to stop barking, as due to their innate sense of hearing, they hear the slightest noise and will bark at anything; they make perfect guard dogs that way. Also, the chizer breed does not like the cold, and does not cope well is cold temperatures, mostly due to its small stature; therefore, this makes it difficult to train these dogs to go to the bathroom outside, as most chizers tend to be paper or pad trained. This can also make it difficult in winter climates to take the breed for the daily walk required, as most chizers will not go outside in anything past -10 Celsius.",CAR_3f24fb156d036d88bfe464a8b2644f4d506eb141,0," Alopekis dogs represent a type dating back to the pre-specialisation era, since they combine hunting, herding and guarding abilities and other primitive characteristics of conformation and behaviour. The passage from Ctesias, mentioned by Julius Pollux, about the Cynomolgus dogs of Crete ), is especially interesting, as it refers to dogs co-existing with buffalo  cattle herds and even suckling the milking cows and competing with bulls. It is possible that descendants of those dogs travelled to Northern Europe with the Greeks, the Romans, the Celts and later the Romani people (according to folk traditions) and contributed to breeds such as the Welsh Corgi  and the Lancashire Heeler. The ancestors of the latter are said to have been brought to Britain by Romani people from the Mediterranean. The fact that these breeds are the only (together with the Alopekis) small  size contemporary breeds specializing in cattle-driving and herding (cattle dogs being in their vast majority much larger and of molossoid  molosser type), is quite remarkable in itself; it could also be seen as additional evidence, apart from the obvious physical similarities, that there is a shared genetic relation and common adaptation and specialization of the herding instinct in all these three breeds, originating in the Eastern regions of Crete (where marshland habitats were ideal for water buffalo herds), given the specific importance of the bull worship in the island's ancient history. The Bull games or Taurokathapsia (Bull-leaping), a form of gymnastics performed by young acrobats and bulls in ancient Crete, are quite well-known; reading Ctesias' report, one wonders if dogs were ever included, or used to control any bull that became too aggressive during the games or the training sessions. (This passage also underlines the co-existence and inevitable genetic interaction between Cretan populations of Alopekis and Cretan Hounds . According to a very interesting report recorded by the Hellenic Association for the Protection and Rescue of Native Farm and Domestic Animals Breeds Amaltheia, there was until very recently a group of Alopekis dogs escorting water buffalo herds in Northern Greece . One of the areas where the breed still co-exists with water buffalo (brought to Greece by invading armies during the Persian Wars) is Serres . And the breed still serves flocks of sheep and goats and cattle also, in other parts of the country, to this day (see pictures).",CAR_3fc2df38904803a250ab5b4324bed370f9e5b805,0," In 1935, Dutch breeder Leendert Saarloos (18841969) started cross-breeding a German Shepherd male to a female European wolf (Canis lupus lupus) which he obtained from Diergaarde Blijdorp, the Rotterdam Zoo. Although he was passionate about the German Shepherd, he found most dogs to be too domesticated and wanted to breed in more natural properties in order to get better working dogs. The result wasn't entirely what Saarloos had hoped for. This breed is cautious, reserved and lacks the ferocity to attack. Until Leendert Saarloos died in 1969, he was in full control over the breeding of his European wolfdog. The Dutch Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1975. To honour its creator they changed the name to Saarloos Wolfdog. In 1981 the breed was recognized by the Fdration Cynologique Internationale (FCI). In the past, some Saarloos wolfdogs were trained as guide dogs for the blind and as rescue dogs, but most dogs of this breed are currently kept as family dogs.",CAR_4762fb9dbad2366400848e6b1d3be09f1b7ec6e3,0,,

Four breeds were the result of intentional crosses with German Shepherds (one of the original intentionally bred wolf-dog crossbreeds), and have distinguishing characteristics of appearance that may reflect the varying subspecies of wolf that contributed to their foundation stock. Other, more unusual crosses have occurred; recent experiments in Germany were conducted in the crossing of wolves and Poodles.

These include search and rescue, cadaver searching, narcotics detection, explosives detection, accelerant detection and mine detection dog, among others. They are suited for these lines of work because of their keen sense of smell and their ability to work regardless of distractions.At one time the German Shepherd was the breed chosen almost exclusively to be used as a guide dog for the visually impaired. When formal guide dog training began in Switzerland in the 1920s under the leadership of Dorothy Eustis, all of the dogs trained were German Shepherd females. An experiment in temperament testing of a group of Labrador Retrievers and German Shepherds showed that the Retrievers scored higher on average in emotional stability and ability to recover promptly from frightening situations, cooperative behavior and friendliness; while the German Shepherds were superior in aggression and defensive behavior. These results suggested that Labrador Retrievers were more suited to guide dog work while German Shepherds were more suited to police work.Currently, Labradors and Golden Retrievers are more widely used for this work, although there are still German Shepherds being trained. In 2013, about 15% of the dogs trained by Guide Dogs of America are German Shepherds, while the remainder are Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers. The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association in the United Kingdom states that crosses between Golden Retrievers and Labrador Retrievers make the best guide dogs, although they also train some German Shepherds, as well as some other breeds.

Nevertheless, the Shar Pei is extremely devoted, loyal and affectionate to its family and is amenable to accepting strangers given time and proper introduction at a young age. If poorly socialized or trained, it can become especially territorial and aggressive. Even friendly and well-socialized individuals will retain the breed's watch dog proclivities (like barking at strangers). It is a largely silent breed, barking only when it is playing or worried. The Shar-Pei were originally bred as palace guards in China. Although Shar-Pei are sometimes stubborn, they are receptive to fair, compassionate training. With repetition and a clear reward system, training is not very difficult, however they do not respond well to negative and cruel treatment. Overall, the Shar Pei can be a dog that is loyal and loving to its family while being very protective.

Named types of dogs that are not dog breeds are still being used where function or use is more important than appearance, especially for herding or hunting, as with the herding dog types of New Zealand that are described by their exact function (Heading Dog, Huntaway, Stopping Dog, etc. - functional terms, not necessarily breed names).",CAR_ccb028783a7bc21e0406cbd7f97370a489a4f2c8,0," The breed is a prominent participant in conformation shows for purebred dogs. The Golden Retriever is popular as a disability assistance dog such as being a guide dog for the blind and a hearing dog for the deaf. In addition, they are trained to be a hunting dog, a detection dog, and a search and rescue participant. The breed's friendly, gentle temperament means it is unsuited to being a professional guard dog, but its temperament has also made it the third-most popular family dog breed (by registration) in the United States,the fifth-most popular in Australia,and the eighth-most popular in the United Kingdom.

The reinforcement social system is used to correct bad behaviors and to praise good ones. Getting by with no punishment for bad behavior can lead a dog to take on that trait. Both dogs and cats can obtain fleas while outdoors. These make them very uncomfortable, and they can pass them to other pets and sims. When grown up, adult dogs can learn tricks, guard the house, and hunt for objects. They can be taught six tricks: sit, sit up, play dead, roll over, speak, and shake. Dogs can also be taught to hunt.

Dogs can run alone if there are no other dogs of the same breed entered, but their scores will not qualify towards a title unless they defeat a hound in a Best of Breed run.  Running order is determined by a random draw, and is not based on size or comparable ability. Dogs can compete in open stake, field champion stake (for dogs who have earned the requisite points), or veteran stake (dogs over the age of 6 years, except Irish Wolfhounds (5 years), and Whippets (7 years)). Each dog runs twice during the trial.  The first run is the preliminary.  After all preliminaries have been run, the course is reversed for the second run, called finals.  Once all preliminaries and finals have been run, Best of Breed is determined for each breed by stakes run-off or by forfeit. All placements must be determined by total score (preliminary + final), run-off, or forfeit.  After the Best of Breed runs, the top dogs from each breed compete for Best in Field to determine the best hound for the trial. Some clubs opt to provide a Best in Event which brings Best of Breed dogs from multiple days to run off.  In AKC trials, Italian Greyhounds are not permitted to compete for Best In Field.  This is because Italian Greyhounds have been known to be mistaken as prey by the larger sighthound breeds.",CAR_cfa3005c594889064f71d92826318d78d6d9962b,0," The Karakachan dog is a very ancient breed of livestock guarding dog. It originate from the shepherd dogs of theancient Thracians and Asian Livestock guardian dogs of the proto-Bulgarians. Karakachan people had bred thisdog conservatively and had formed its present type. Due to its perfect working qualities this breed has beenwidely used by shepherds in Bulgaria.Similarly to the above two breeds, the socialist regime almost manages to annihilate the Karakachan dog.Up to day the government has not supported the breed survival in any way, except including it in the Red DataList of the autochthonic forms of domestic animals as a disappearing breed (or critical).Semperviva started the work for saving the Karakachan dog in 1992. Since the beginning a breeding stationhas been established, where the breeding process is made on the base of aboriginal dogs. A breed standard anda herd book were worked out. An International Karakachan Dog Association was founded. Semperviva hasalways aimed to save this breed as a working dog with its original qualities. In this aspect, since 1997, incooperation with the Balkani Wildlife Society, dogs have been provided to livestock breeders for protection of their flocks against predators. In this way it is aimed to decrease the conflict between people and large carnivores (wolves and bears) and to restore the breed in its natural environment. This particular project has been supported by several foundations in different years of its implementation: European Natural Heritage Fund  Euronatur, GzSW, UK Wolf Conservation Trust and Alertis. Thanks to these activities there is a slight trend of increase of working dogs. The three breeds, subject of the project have been selected by Karakachan people, which are ancient, autochthonic, ethnic group of nomad livestock breeders. The three breeds, which are one of the oldest in Europe, had been numerous in Bulgaria before the nationalization of the private property during the socialist regime. As a consequence of that time politics in the farming practice, these breeds have been massively crossbred with foreign more productive ones and also huge numbers of them have been exterminated without control. All this have brought these karakachan breeds to the edge of extinction. In addition, nowadays the mountain livestock breeding is a losing practice. The government does not actively stimulate private livestock breeders to keep and work with autochthonic breeds.",CAR_d03de81b55e81ac65d92fc39cef870604a9acfe5,0,,

It is best to train this dog at a young age, because some habits will stick as they become older. However, training these dogs while they are older is still possible. Like many toy breeds, the Havanese can be difficult to housebreak. However, Havanese can be trained to use a litter box, which can greatly reduce issues with housebreaking. This breed is very smart and can be house trained faster than most toy dogs. The Havanese get very attached and are very loyal to their owners, and often attach to one person which they will closely follow. As a result, the Havanese does not do well in a household where it will be left alone all day. Although the Havanese is an active and lively dog, they are small enough that many of their exercise needs can be met in a house or yard, and therefore they do not require as much vigorous exercise as other breeds may. However, exercise is still necessary for this breed to be happy and healthy.

Boxers are brachycephalic (they have broad, short skulls), have a square muzzle, mandibular prognathism (an underbite), very strong jaws, and a powerful bite ideal for hanging on to large prey. The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser which became extinct by crossbreeding rather than by a decadence of the breed. The purpose of the crossbreeding was the wish to eliminate the excessive white color of the breed, and the necessity of producing thousands of dogs for one of the most popular breeds in the world.

One point of view is that certain dog breeds are a public safety issue that merits actions such as banning ownership, mandatory spayneuter for all dogs of these breeds, mandatory microchip implants and liability insurance, or prohibiting people convicted of a felony from owning them. Another point of view is that comprehensive dog bite legislation, coupled with better consumer education and legally mandating responsible pet keeping practices, is a better solution than breed-specific legislation to the problem of dangerous dogs. A third point of view is that breed-specific legislation should not ban breeds entirely, but should strictly regulate the conditions under which specific breeds could be owned, e.g., forbidding certain classes of individuals from owning them, specifying public areas in which they would be prohibited, and establishing conditions, such as requiring a dog to wear a muzzle, for taking dogs from specific breeds into public places.

It is based on a survey of more than 6000 people who took a personality test and reported on their experiences with the various dogs that they have owned.

It is believed the Ibizan Hound evolves from the tesem, the ancient Egyptian hunting dog. Representations of this dog on the walls of ancient tombs show a striking similarity to the modern Ibizan Hound. These dogs would have been brought to the island of Eivissa by the Phoenicians, who founded settlements there as early as the 8th century BC. A recent DNA analysis did not find support for this opinion and did not include the Ibizan Hound among their identified ancient dog breeds. A more recent article argues that continued trait selective breeding may be behind this lack of support. Heidi G. Parker, the lead author of the original study has stated recently that indeed their original findings do not imply that the Ibizan Hound is not an ancient breed and that with better tools they would in all likelihood be able to trace a continuous lineage of thousands of years for many dog breeds and add them to their group of ancient dogs.",CAR_2a0ca814e3643c9ffdfaeb6b5f02f11e889c7db4,0," Your dog bleeds during the proestrus stage of its cycle, which typically lasts about seven to 10 days.

The Franzuskaya Bolonka is white, while the Tsvetnaya and Zwetna are black, brown, gray, red or wolf-gray. The breed is known for its soft, wavy to curly coat in a variety of colors. They have ears that are neither too long nor too short. Male Bolonkas have a distinct beard and moustache that sets them apart from their female counterparts. Bolonka tails are supposed to have the tip touching the back. Similar to other Bichon breeds, Bolonki do not shed. Daily brushing of the coat helps to prevent matting. If a Bolonka's coat gets severely matted, they may develop a hematoma. Bolonka dogs are considered suitable for people with allergies, as they are bred to be hypoallergenic. Breeds that don't shed are more likely to be hypoallergenic, since the dog's dander and saliva stick to the hair and are not released into the environment. The frequent trimming, brushing, and bathing required to keep the Bolonka looking its best removes hair and dander and controls saliva.

This shift away from neuropsychological research also marked a shift in his publishing strategy, away from single study publications in research journals, to publication of his new data as part of material presented in book form. Many of his books on dogs do contain hithertofore unpublished empirical data. For example, his book The Intelligence of Dogs is based on a survey sent to all of the dog obedience judges in the United States and Canada, and resulted in the ranking of 110 dog breeds by intelligence. This ranking caused a rather large media stir. His book Why we love the dogs we do looks at the personality of people and how the owner's personality predicts their relationship with various dog breeds. It is based on a survey of more than 6000 people who took a personality test and reported on their experiences with the various dogs that they have owned. This book proved to be very popular and Coren's personality test is now used by some dog shelters to determine whether prospective owners are suitable for a particular breed of dog. Similarly, his book Why does my dog act that way? uses data from approximately a thousand dogs to determine features of the personality of various dog breeds. However other books that he has written on dog behavior have provided less formal data presentation and in these his creative contribution is based on the organization and interpretation of the research of others, as is the case in How to speak dog.

They are multi-purpose, have got excellent sense of smell, absolute pitch and good eyesight. They are tireless and with good anger towards predators. At the same time, theyve got kind character and are very faithful to people. Yakutian Laikas are not demanding to conditions of life and easily endure the hostile climate of northern Siberia. In harsh Siberian conditions they reveal their stamina; they tend to work in small groups and can work through the whole day, from dawn to sunset. Popularity of dog sledding appeared with the arrival of Russian traders to the Arctic. With the increased demand for white polar foxes in the 17th century, the Arctic exploration received its spike. Furs and mammoth tusks trade became local nations main income. Origin and subsequent formation of the breed are still not quite known, but because of the hard to access country and extreme natural conditions, Yakutian Laikas have lived as primitive aboriginal breeds; they were rarely confined and mated free. Naturally, local type dogs could be preserved only under conditions of complete isolation from dogs of other breeds. First scientific descriptions of dogs of Yakutia were published in late 18th century, when first geographic studies of the north were conducted. Prince Shirinsky-Shikhmatov wrote in his monograph about Laikas: Researchers of the north, of course, could not overlook northern dog; they could not disagree with hard fact that presence of this dog makes life of northern people possible. It is even more strange that so little attention was paid to description of dogs of the north; their ancestral aboriginal type and numerous varieties remain obscure. There are as many types of Laikas as ethnic minorities of the north; varieties of Laikas differ clearly from each other, each has its own peculiarities and their division is indisputable. This monograph was written in 1898. Russian Geographic Society gave task to Mr. Maak to investigate Vilyuisk District. Review of Vilyuiks District of Yakutian Provionce was published in 1877. Maak wrote: I saw dog of very typical appearance and very common in Siberia, which was fox-like. In 1896, V. L. Seroshevsky published a book Yakuts, edited by N. I. Veselovsky. Describing dogs of Yakuts, Seroshevsky divides them into two groups, 1) guarding and hunting dogs and 2) maritime sled dogs. He wrote: even most poor Yakut having no other animals, has at least one dog. Yokhelson (Johelson?), 1898, in his publication Hunting Industry in Kolyma Territory of Yakutian Province and described the Tungus Lajka used for sledding and hunting dogs. He wrote: There are two breeds of dogs, one is so-called Tungus Laika, a pointed-eared dog of nomadic reindeer herders and polar sled dog. All researchers described dogs of Yakutia as one breed of polar sled dogs. Yokhelson wrote: Sled dog is a burden animal not only of nomads living in not forested country, but also of settled near the river Russians and russified minorities and the dog of majority of cattle keeping Yakuts. Except southwestern part of the territory, one can find 5-6 dogs in every yurta, which are used for hauling firewood and other works needed by the household. The polar dog is not big, 50-60 cm at the shoulder In the appearance, with his prick ears, oblique set eyes, thick coat and broad massive head, pointed muzzle, low carried tail (when the dog is tired, eats or in a bad mood), the dog is very similar to wolf. Among them, there are shaggy dogs, and somewhat blunt muzzle not different from our Spitzes  Generally, type of Kolyma sled dog is diverse and, perhaps, it is a mix between Kamchatka and Eskimo sled dogs with another imported breed. It stands to a reason that other dogs relocated here together with new immigrants.

It has a pronounced ridge on its back formed by hair growing in the opposite direction that extends from behind the withers to the hips. Puppies are occasionally born ridgeless. Thai Ridgebacks have a muscular and streamlined body, making them extremely agile. The tail is carried upward called a sickle or sword tail. Its forehead wrinkles with enormous expression.  Like many eastern breeds,  the Thai Ridgeback has retained a  'scissor jaw' where upper and lower teeth interlock when the jaw bones clamp down.  The tongue can be black or have black marks.  Eyes are almond-shaped and brown but may be amber in blue dogs. The ears are set low and point slightly outward. The ears stand up progressively during the puppy growth period, they are not cropped. The back is straight and level. The coat is short, hard, and straight. Due to the length and density of the coat shedding is minimal, occurring once or twice yearly.

In harsh Siberian conditions they reveal their stamina; they tend to work in small groups and can work through the whole day, from dawn to sunset. Popularity of dog sledding appeared with the arrival of Russian traders to the Arctic. With the increased demand for white polar foxes in the 17th century, the Arctic exploration received its spike. Furs and mammoth tusks trade became local nations main income. Origin and subsequent formation of the breed are still not quite known, but because of the hard to access country and extreme natural conditions, Yakutian Laikas have lived as primitive aboriginal breeds; they were rarely confined and mated free. Naturally, local type dogs could be preserved only under conditions of complete isolation from dogs of other breeds. First scientific descriptions of dogs of Yakutia were published in late 18th century, when first geographic studies of the north were conducted. Prince Shirinsky-Shikhmatov wrote in his monograph about Laikas: Researchers of the north, of course, could not overlook northern dog; they could not disagree with hard fact that presence of this dog makes life of northern people possible. It is even more strange that so little attention was paid to description of dogs of the north; their ancestral aboriginal type and numerous varieties remain obscure. There are as many types of Laikas as ethnic minorities of the north; varieties of Laikas differ clearly from each other, each has its own peculiarities and their division is indisputable. This monograph was written in 1898. Russian Geographic Society gave task to Mr. Maak to investigate Vilyuisk District. Review of Vilyuiks District of Yakutian Provionce was published in 1877. Maak wrote: I saw dog of very typical appearance and very common in Siberia, which was fox-like. In 1896, V. L. Seroshevsky published a book Yakuts, edited by N. I. Veselovsky. Describing dogs of Yakuts, Seroshevsky divides them into two groups, 1) guarding and hunting dogs and 2) maritime sled dogs. He wrote: even most poor Yakut having no other animals, has at least one dog. Yokhelson (Johelson?), 1898, in his publication Hunting Industry in Kolyma Territory of Yakutian Province and described the Tungus Lajka used for sledding and hunting dogs. He wrote: There are two breeds of dogs, one is so-called Tungus Laika, a pointed-eared dog of nomadic reindeer herders and polar sled dog. All researchers described dogs of Yakutia as one breed of polar sled dogs. Yokhelson wrote: Sled dog is a burden animal not only of nomads living in not forested country, but also of settled near the river Russians and russified minorities and the dog of majority of cattle keeping Yakuts. Except southwestern part of the territory, one can find 5-6 dogs in every yurta, which are used for hauling firewood and other works needed by the household.

Among them, there are shaggy dogs, and somewhat blunt muzzle not different from our Spitzes  Generally, type of Kolyma sled dog is diverse and, perhaps, it is a mix between Kamchatka and Eskimo sled dogs with another imported breed. It stands to a reason that other dogs relocated here together with new immigrants. Both Seroshevsky and Yokhelson described the Yakutian Sled Dog similarly: Legs relatively thick and short, chest, which is used to pull sleds, perfectly developed; neck is thick and short.

In addition, they must be geographically spread across twenty states or more, and finally the clubs by-laws and constitution must be reviewed as well as breed observations made by AKC staff. There is a typical stay of between one and three years in the Miscellaneous Class before full recognition is granted.

Advocate for a park on the local level with partners that can help, like public parks staff, solicit for funding, and establish a set of firm rules that will be strictly enforced by dog park officials. A primary objective - and one of the toughest - is to ensure that the location is appropriate for the dogs, their owners, and the community. The park should not be placed in environmentally sensitive areas, and it must be free of poisonous plants that might hurt the dogs and dangerous topography such as steep cliffs that might present a danger to their owners. The second objective is to ensure that the park is safe for dogs, people, and wildlife. This generally will require the park to be  some distance away from traffic to mitigate any concerns, and always requires an appropriate fence or barrier to ensure that dogs do not run away and end up in precarious situations, and adequate lighting if dog parks are open past sunset. A third objective is to make sure the size of the dog park is appropriate. Dog parks that are too big can result in opportunities for dogs to learn and demonstrate anti-social, dominant behavior, which can result in fights without swift intervention by their guardians. Smaller dog parks allow an owner to react more quickly if their dog becomes unruly, but these allow only a few dogs in at a time.",CAR_092f20a32f30d3ee98e6939dfffb2fe6feee4dac,0," Activities include the Mega Snow Coaster, which was once the largest tubing park in North America, snowmobile tours, Kids snow mobile rides, sleigh riding, dog sleds, snowshoeing through Big White's beautiful trails, and ice skating on the Olympic sized outdoor rink with a scenic view.

They are multi-purpose, have got excellent sense of smell, absolute pitch and good eyesight. They are tireless and with good anger towards predators. At the same time, theyve got kind character and are very faithful to people. Yakutian Laikas are not demanding to conditions of life and easily endure the hostile climate of northern Siberia. In harsh Siberian conditions they reveal their stamina; they tend to work in small groups and can work through the whole day, from dawn to sunset. Popularity of dog sledding appeared with the arrival of Russian traders to the Arctic. With the increased demand for white polar foxes in the 17th century, the Arctic exploration received its spike. Furs and mammoth tusks trade became local nations main income. Origin and subsequent formation of the breed are still not quite known, but because of the hard to access country and extreme natural conditions, Yakutian Laikas have lived as primitive aboriginal breeds; they were rarely confined and mated free. Naturally, local type dogs could be preserved only under conditions of complete isolation from dogs of other breeds. First scientific descriptions of dogs of Yakutia were published in late 18th century, when first geographic studies of the north were conducted. Prince Shirinsky-Shikhmatov wrote in his monograph about Laikas: Researchers of the north, of course, could not overlook northern dog; they could not disagree with hard fact that presence of this dog makes life of northern people possible. It is even more strange that so little attention was paid to description of dogs of the north; their ancestral aboriginal type and numerous varieties remain obscure. There are as many types of Laikas as ethnic minorities of the north; varieties of Laikas differ clearly from each other, each has its own peculiarities and their division is indisputable. This monograph was written in 1898. Russian Geographic Society gave task to Mr. Maak to investigate Vilyuisk District. Review of Vilyuiks District of Yakutian Provionce was published in 1877. Maak wrote: I saw dog of very typical appearance and very common in Siberia, which was fox-like. In 1896, V. L. Seroshevsky published a book Yakuts, edited by N. I. Veselovsky. Describing dogs of Yakuts, Seroshevsky divides them into two groups, 1) guarding and hunting dogs and 2) maritime sled dogs. He wrote: even most poor Yakut having no other animals, has at least one dog. Yokhelson (Johelson?), 1898, in his publication Hunting Industry in Kolyma Territory of Yakutian Province and described the Tungus Lajka used for sledding and hunting dogs. He wrote: There are two breeds of dogs, one is so-called Tungus Laika, a pointed-eared dog of nomadic reindeer herders and polar sled dog. All researchers described dogs of Yakutia as one breed of polar sled dogs. Yokhelson wrote: Sled dog is a burden animal not only of nomads living in not forested country, but also of settled near the river Russians and russified minorities and the dog of majority of cattle keeping Yakuts. Except southwestern part of the territory, one can find 5-6 dogs in every yurta, which are used for hauling firewood and other works needed by the household.

Among them, there are shaggy dogs, and somewhat blunt muzzle not different from our Spitzes  Generally, type of Kolyma sled dog is diverse and, perhaps, it is a mix between Kamchatka and Eskimo sled dogs with another imported breed. It stands to a reason that other dogs relocated here together with new immigrants. Both Seroshevsky and Yokhelson described the Yakutian Sled Dog similarly: Legs relatively thick and short, chest, which is used to pull sleds, perfectly developed; neck is thick and short.

The young dog is often particularly active, and this high level of activity may lead them to attempt ill-advised feats of athleticism that can result in injury. Due to their size, and in some lineages poor bone density, they are prone to broken legs. Italian Greyhounds make reasonably good watchdogs, as they bark at unfamiliar sounds. They may also bark at passers-by and other animals.

It requires patience and consistent positive training. Harsh methods will often result in fear andor aggression.  A positive, even-handed approach works best with this intelligent yet headstrong terrier.  It is an enthusiastic greeter, and will often jump up to lick a person's face, commonly referred to as the Wheaten greetin.Wheatens are considered less scrappy than other terriers, but they are true terriers and will be more active than many other breeds. For this reason these dogs do best when they are exercised regularly. They are cool weather dogs and can become easily overheated in hot weather. If socialised with cats and puppies, they may get along fine with them; if not, care should be taken in introducing them to cats, as the breed has a very strong prey drive because of its vermin-hunting origin. Wheatens can get along well with other dogs if properly socialised.  They are extremely friendly and loving pets. Wheatens are very protective of their families and, although they may bark an alert at strangers, they rarely get aggressive.

In Richmond, Virginia, when a dog fighter was sentenced in June 2007, it was revealed in court that over a dozen of his dogs had to be euthanized, either because of serious illness, injury or malnutrition, or because their training as fighting dogs made them too dangerous for adoption. Until 2006, the man had kept 16 pit bulls in the backyard of his house, confined with heavy chains used for automobile towing. Experts say chaining the animals is a dogfighting technique for building strength.  When an animal control officer arrived in response to a complaint from a neighbor that one of the dogs had died, he found the dead dog in a trash can.

By 1969 the fledgling club had 12 members and formally applied to the AKC for instructions. One of the requirements was that the Club had to start keeping its own registry for the breed and that all dogs on the registry would have to be an extension of the Australian registry, tracing back to registered dogs in Australia. The AKC Parent Club members began researching their dogs, including exchanging correspondence with McNiven, and discovered that few of them had dogs that could be traced back to dogs registered in Australia. The AKC took over the club registry in 1979 and the breed was fully recognised in September 1980.

However, in recent years, the consumption of dog meat in certain areas of the country, especially in certain northeastern provinces like Sakon Nakhon and Nakhon Phanom, notably Sakon Nakhon province's Tha Rae sub-district, which has been identified as the main center for the country's illegal, albeit lucrative, dog meat trade, has attracted widespread attention from the Thai population and local news media. This has led large groups of Thai citizens to become increasingly vocal against the consumption of dog meat and the selling of dogs that are transported through Laos to neighbouring Mekong countries, including Vietnam and China. According to news reports, a considerable number of these dogs continue to be stolen from people's homes by illegal carriers. This was also the case following the 2011 Thailand Floods.

The descendants are very influenced by the myth of the big grey dog as being a deathly curse. This instils fear in them, which causes their deaths. It ultimately took over their lives and they feared anything bad could happen to them with the thought of the big grey dog.

Louis IV of France presented the Bolonka as gifts to Russian nobility. Later, the ancestors of the Russian Tsvetnaya Bolonka migrated to Russia with Napoleons army and they were known as the French Bolonka. Russia was never known for its toy breeds, partly because of its environment and its economic need for working dogs. Smaller breeds were considered superfluous and unnecessary, even more so during the Soviet Regime. During this time, dogs were not imported to Russia, so breeds were developed by selections from existing breeds. Being unable to import dogs from outside of Russia, the Bolonka was developed by localized breeding through dog lovers in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, who looked to the ancestors of smaller dogs such as the Bichon, Toy Poodle, Shih Tzu, Pekingese and French Bolognese, with a view to creating a toy sized lap dog that would have the right temperament for apartment living. Since 1966, they have been called Russian Tsvetnaya Bolonka. Interest in the specific breed of Bolonka revived after the fall of the Iron Curtain.Similarly, through the connection between the Russian and French aristocracy in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a dog similar to the Bichon Fris or Bolognese of today was brought to Tsarist Russia. These little white dogs were favorites of the fashionable ladies of the period in both countries. After the Russian Revolution, the breed was isolated from the French dogs. The little dogs began to be taken seriously as a native Russian breed in the 1950s, and grew in popularity. Export of the dogs was strictly regulated. In 1978 a breeding pair of Franzuskaya Bolonka was sent as a diplomatic gift from the Soviet Union into the GDR. From these and a few others, the white Franzuskaya Bolonka began to be developed as a breed in Germany in the 1980s. Eventually it was recognized by the VDF (Verband fr das Deutsche Hundewesen) as a variation of the Italian Bolognese.

It originate from the shepherd dogs of theancient Thracians and Asian Livestock guardian dogs of the proto-Bulgarians. Karakachan people had bred thisdog conservatively and had formed its present type. Due to its perfect working qualities this breed has beenwidely used by shepherds in Bulgaria.Similarly to the above two breeds, the socialist regime almost manages to annihilate the Karakachan dog.Up to day the government has not supported the breed survival in any way, except including it in the Red DataList of the autochthonic forms of domestic animals as a disappearing breed (or critical).Semperviva started the work for saving the Karakachan dog in 1992. Since the beginning a breeding stationhas been established, where the breeding process is made on the base of aboriginal dogs. A breed standard anda herd book were worked out. An International Karakachan Dog Association was founded. Semperviva hasalways aimed to save this breed as a working dog with its original qualities. In this aspect, since 1997, incooperation with the Balkani Wildlife Society, dogs have been provided to livestock breeders for protection of their flocks against predators. In this way it is aimed to decrease the conflict between people and large carnivores (wolves and bears) and to restore the breed in its natural environment. This particular project has been supported by several foundations in different years of its implementation: European Natural Heritage Fund  Euronatur, GzSW, UK Wolf Conservation Trust and Alertis. Thanks to these activities there is a slight trend of increase of working dogs. The three breeds, subject of the project have been selected by Karakachan people, which are ancient, autochthonic, ethnic group of nomad livestock breeders. The three breeds, which are one of the oldest in Europe, had been numerous in Bulgaria before the nationalization of the private property during the socialist regime. As a consequence of that time politics in the farming practice, these breeds have been massively crossbred with foreign more productive ones and also huge numbers of them have been exterminated without control. All this have brought these karakachan breeds to the edge of extinction. In addition, nowadays the mountain livestock breeding is a losing practice. The government does not actively stimulate private livestock breeders to keep and work with autochthonic breeds.",CAR_d03de81b55e81ac65d92fc39cef870604a9acfe5,0," The frequency of barking in dogs in relation to wolves could also be the product of the very different social environment of dogs. Dogs live in extraordinarily close range with humans, in many societies kept solely as companion animals. From a very young age, humans tend to be one of a dogs primary social contacts. This captive environment presents very different stimuli than would be found by wolves in the wild. While wolves have vast territories, dogs do not. The boundaries of a captive dogs territory will be visited frequently by intruders, thus triggering the bark response as a warning. Additionally, dogs densely populate urban areas, allowing more opportunity to meet new dogs and be social. For example, it is possible that kenneled dogs may have increased barking due to a desire to facilitate social behavior. Dogs close relationship with humans also renders dogs reliant on humans, even for basic needs. Barking is a way to attract attention, and the behavior is continued by the positive response exhibited by the owners (e.g., if a dog barks to get food and the owner feeds it, the dog is being conditioned to continue said behavior).",CAR_d63f4768dd80af3bffa7de0e25e698c3fde8cf4c,0," Dingoes have been variously considered to be wild dogs, the progenitor of domestic dogs, the ancestor of modern dog breeds, a separate species, a link between wolf and domestic dog, a primitive canine species or primitive domestic dog, a dog-like relative of wolves or a subspecies of the domestic dog. Others consider them to be native dogs of Asia, a relatively unchanged form of early domestic dog, part wolf and part dog, or to have been selectively bred from wolves. Then again, some do not consider dingoes feral any more but completely wild, since they have been living under natural selection for a very long time. According to present scientific consensus and knowledge, dingoes are domestic dogs that arrived at their present distribution with humans, adapted to the respective conditions and are no more primitive or primordial than other domestic dogs.The Australian dingo has never been subject to the artificial selection that produced modern dog breeds, and it may be an undomesticated descendant of an extinct Asian wolf. However, compared to the European grey wolf, dingoes have an approximately 30% lower relative brain size, reduced facial expressions, reduced impressive behaviour, curled tails that can be carried over the back, and generally a permanent fertility in malesfeatures that all known domestic dogs share and are considered to be caused by domestication. It might happen that one and the same source names the dingo as a subspecies of the grey wolf, but lists all other domestic dogs as separate species. Likewise, the scientific name of the dingo might be Canis lupus dingo, but the dingo is regarded as a separate species, nonetheless.Alfred Brehm originally considered the dingo to be a separate species but, after examining several different specimens, he came to the conclusion that they could only be domestic dogs. In contrast, William Jardine considered the dingo to be an entirely separate species, while contemporary French naturalists regarded them as feral dogs. Even among modern-day scientists, dingoes and other domestic dogs are sometimes considered two separate species, despite small genetic, morphological and behavioural differences.",CAR_d8379412b0a65c1ffbaeb2bb85b4c854d3e9b2f5,0," His initial research involved the behavior and ecology of tenebrionid beetles and their response to vertebrate predators. However, in the mid-1980s he switched his research efforts to studying the social behavior and communication of prairie dogs. He has been decoding the communication system of alarm calls, and he and his students have found that prairie dogs have a sophisticated communication system that can identify the species of predator and provides descriptive information about the size, shape, and color of the individual predator animal. His research in prairie dog communication has also shown displacement, the ability to communicate about things that are not present. This finding challenges prior theories on animal communication, since only humans have been known to use this linguistic process. In addition, his work with prairie dogs suggests that they may have a complex communication system that borders on language. Not only do they have a developed communication system as described above, they also have different escape behaviors in response to different predator calls. His research with the prairie dogs also helps to explain why animals have social behavior. Because these animals form a colony, they form a set of different social groups, which apparently exist for other reasons besides mating and may be a way to take advantage of limited resources.

They are intensely loyal and patient pets who appreciate attention but may also be somewhat aloof or independent, as well as thoroughly cunning, particularly with strangers. They rank a low 42nd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, but keep in mind that Coren's criteria focus on how fast a dog can learn obedience tricksa limited test of intelligence. The kuvasz breed is for experienced handlers only. The combination of intelligence, independence and protectiveness make obedience training and socialization absolute necessities. They are strictly working dogs, bred for centuries to think independently and act without instruction, scanning and evaluating the environment and taking protective or deterrent action as needed. This was a vital trait in their solitary duties protecting livestock. That independence can make training a difficult task, wearing on the patience of even experienced owners. Kuvasz quickly understand what is being asked of them, but they have to respect a person as a trusted leader before they'll obey commands. They're also not usually interested in meaningless activity, such as doing entertaining tricks. As a result, they are not recommended for novices and those who do not have time to train and socialize them properly. An adolescent Kuvasz should be able to learn basic obedience commands and consistently respond to them; however the instinctive need to investigate strangers and protect its owner may cause the Kuvasz to act independently when off leash and ignore the calls of a frustrated handler. Interactions with other dogs, especially first meetings, should be managed carefully. One of the tasks of a livestock guardian is to kill wolves, coyotes, and other predators, and this instinct remains intact in the modern dog. Handlers should be alert to signs of tension, and intervene before a dangerous situation develops. However, a well socialized, well trained kuvasz will usually ignore, play with, or go exploring with other dogs once a successful introduction has been made.Finally, a potential owner should refrain from purchasing a Kuvasz if barking will be a problem at the home. While not every Kuvasz is prone to barking (socializing them will define what is a threat), many of them fulfill their guardian role by vocally warning off potential threats, both real and imagined. On the other hand, many of these qualities make the Kuvasz excellent guardians for sheep or large estates. The Kuvasz has a very special, close connection to his owner or family, as well as anyone in their circle, human or animal. that the dog considers part of the flock. He will protect all of them. He may also police interactions among them, such as discouraging rough play by herding rowdy individuals away from the group. The owner has the responsibility for setting clear, consistent limits on this behavior. That connection can easily be lost if the dog is humiliated, confused by contradictory commands, or otherwise abused.

The Havanese get very attached and are very loyal to their owners, and often attach to one person which they will closely follow. As a result, the Havanese does not do well in a household where it will be left alone all day.

Again, in the free-running tests the dogs were fitted with a shock collar, which was used to deter approaches to within 1-2m of the sheep. Dogs that had previously been shocked in year 1 showed a significant increased in latency to approach a person during the path test (p0.001), even though this was not a condition under which shocks had been delivered. Owners reported behavioral differences between year 1 and 2 in 24 of the dogs. 18 of the 24 dogs had shown no interest in sheep during that period, even though they had been interested in them during the first year tests. However, only one of those dogs had received shocks, so the change in behaviour could not be attributed to the use of the shock collar. When comparing owners reports for the two years, the dogs showed a weaker inclination for chasing sheep and other prey than previously (p  0:001), but this variable was not affected by shock experience. Dogs that had shown interest in sheep in year 1 showed a persistent interest in year 2. No dogs chased or attacked sheep as their first response, while half of them did so the first year. During the entire test period, the proportion of dogs attacking sheep was reduced to almost one fourth. The number of shocks administered per dog was reduced by the second year, and only one of the dogs which received el. shocks the first year needed el. shocks also the second year.The observations that both receivers and non-receivers of el. shocks the first year showed a reduction in the probability of chasing sheep, but the receivers showing a larger reduction, show that el. shock treatment provides an additional learning response. No adverse effects on the dogs were observed with this training procedure, but in their discussion the authors commented In order to ensure no negative effects, we recommend that the electronic dog collar may be used for such purposes only if it is used by skilled trainers with special competence on dog behaviour, learning mechanisms, and of this particular device.",CAR_eff9c2c0fc15491babb765fa81fa5266224a65d4,0,,

It is a common finding in older female dogs and cats that are not spayed, but they are found in other animals as well.  The mammary glands in dogs and cats are associated with their nipples and extend from the underside of the chest to the groin on both sides of the midline.  There are many differences between mammary tumors in animals and breast cancer in humans, including tumor type, malignancy, and treatment options.  The prevalence in dogs is about three times that of women. In dogs, mammary tumors are the second most common tumor (after skin tumors) over all and the most common tumor in female dogs with a reported incidence of 3.4%.

This purportedly celebrates the summer solstice, however, in 2014, the municipal government published a statement that the festival is not a cultural tradition, rather, a commercial event held by restaurants and the public.  Various dog meat dishes (and more recently, cats) are eaten, washed down by lychees wine.  The festival in 2011 spanned 10 days, during which 15,000 dogs were consumed. Estimates of the number of dogs eaten during the festival range between 10 and 15 thousand.  Festival organisers say that only dogs bred specifically for consumption are used, however, there are claims that some of the dogs purchased for slaughter and consumption are strays or stolen pets, as evidenced by their wearing collars. Some of the dogs eaten at the festival are burnt or boiled alive and there are reports that the dogs are sometimes clubbed or beaten to death in the belief that the increased adrenalin circulating in the dog's body adds to the flavour of the meat.  At the 2015 festival, there were long queues outside large (300-seat) eateries which sold the dog meat for around 4 (5.60) per kilogram. Prior to the 2014 festival, eight dogs (and their two cages) sold for 1,150 yuan ($185) and six puppies for 1,200 yuan.

At the same time, theyve got kind character and are very faithful to people. Yakutian Laikas are not demanding to conditions of life and easily endure the hostile climate of northern Siberia. In harsh Siberian conditions they reveal their stamina; they tend to work in small groups and can work through the whole day, from dawn to sunset. Popularity of dog sledding appeared with the arrival of Russian traders to the Arctic. With the increased demand for white polar foxes in the 17th century, the Arctic exploration received its spike. Furs and mammoth tusks trade became local nations main income. Origin and subsequent formation of the breed are still not quite known, but because of the hard to access country and extreme natural conditions, Yakutian Laikas have lived as primitive aboriginal breeds; they were rarely confined and mated free. Naturally, local type dogs could be preserved only under conditions of complete isolation from dogs of other breeds. First scientific descriptions of dogs of Yakutia were published in late 18th century, when first geographic studies of the north were conducted. Prince Shirinsky-Shikhmatov wrote in his monograph about Laikas: Researchers of the north, of course, could not overlook northern dog; they could not disagree with hard fact that presence of this dog makes life of northern people possible. It is even more strange that so little attention was paid to description of dogs of the north; their ancestral aboriginal type and numerous varieties remain obscure. There are as many types of Laikas as ethnic minorities of the north; varieties of Laikas differ clearly from each other, each has its own peculiarities and their division is indisputable. This monograph was written in 1898. Russian Geographic Society gave task to Mr. Maak to investigate Vilyuisk District. Review of Vilyuiks District of Yakutian Provionce was published in 1877. Maak wrote: I saw dog of very typical appearance and very common in Siberia, which was fox-like. In 1896, V. L. Seroshevsky published a book Yakuts, edited by N. I. Veselovsky. Describing dogs of Yakuts, Seroshevsky divides them into two groups, 1) guarding and hunting dogs and 2) maritime sled dogs. He wrote: even most poor Yakut having no other animals, has at least one dog. Yokhelson (Johelson?), 1898, in his publication Hunting Industry in Kolyma Territory of Yakutian Province and described the Tungus Lajka used for sledding and hunting dogs. He wrote: There are two breeds of dogs, one is so-called Tungus Laika, a pointed-eared dog of nomadic reindeer herders and polar sled dog. All researchers described dogs of Yakutia as one breed of polar sled dogs. Yokhelson wrote: Sled dog is a burden animal not only of nomads living in not forested country, but also of settled near the river Russians and russified minorities and the dog of majority of cattle keeping Yakuts. Except southwestern part of the territory, one can find 5-6 dogs in every yurta, which are used for hauling firewood and other works needed by the household. The polar dog is not big, 50-60 cm at the shoulder In the appearance, with his prick ears, oblique set eyes, thick coat and broad massive head, pointed muzzle, low carried tail (when the dog is tired, eats or in a bad mood), the dog is very similar to wolf. Among them, there are shaggy dogs, and somewhat blunt muzzle not different from our Spitzes  Generally, type of Kolyma sled dog is diverse and, perhaps, it is a mix between Kamchatka and Eskimo sled dogs with another imported breed. It stands to a reason that other dogs relocated here together with new immigrants. Both Seroshevsky and Yokhelson described the Yakutian Sled Dog similarly: Legs relatively thick and short, chest, which is used to pull sleds, perfectly developed; neck is thick and short. Face is unusually intelligent and with melancholic or grim expression. In principle, it remains so today and the dogs little changed with the spreading civilization in the Yakutian north.",CAR_3542fa20c51ca2de096a71df6a466960f665c6a9,0," The chizer mixes the highly active personality of a miniature schnauzer with the big, bold attitude of a Chihuahua, making them sturdy and seemingly tough dogs.

This breed needs daily walks, and constant activity time in order to keep the breed on its best behaviour. The chizer is a good breed for single people or families without children, as it takes serious socialization towards children for the chizer to be comfortable. This breed has be known to nip at small children, and will not take kindly to any children forcefully playing with it. The chizer is a breed that is generally fairly shy, and tends to be scared when meeting new people or other dogs, and again socialization at a young age can alleviate this issue.

By 1969 the fledgling club had 12 members and formally applied to the AKC for instructions. One of the requirements was that the Club had to start keeping its own registry for the breed and that all dogs on the registry would have to be an extension of the Australian registry, tracing back to registered dogs in Australia. The AKC Parent Club members began researching their dogs, including exchanging correspondence with McNiven, and discovered that few of them had dogs that could be traced back to dogs registered in Australia.

Louis IV of France presented the Bolonka as gifts to Russian nobility. Later, the ancestors of the Russian Tsvetnaya Bolonka migrated to Russia with Napoleons army and they were known as the French Bolonka. Russia was never known for its toy breeds, partly because of its environment and its economic need for working dogs. Smaller breeds were considered superfluous and unnecessary, even more so during the Soviet Regime. During this time, dogs were not imported to Russia, so breeds were developed by selections from existing breeds. Being unable to import dogs from outside of Russia, the Bolonka was developed by localized breeding through dog lovers in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, who looked to the ancestors of smaller dogs such as the Bichon, Toy Poodle, Shih Tzu, Pekingese and French Bolognese, with a view to creating a toy sized lap dog that would have the right temperament for apartment living. Since 1966, they have been called Russian Tsvetnaya Bolonka. Interest in the specific breed of Bolonka revived after the fall of the Iron Curtain.Similarly, through the connection between the Russian and French aristocracy in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a dog similar to the Bichon Fris or Bolognese of today was brought to Tsarist Russia. These little white dogs were favorites of the fashionable ladies of the period in both countries. After the Russian Revolution, the breed was isolated from the French dogs. The little dogs began to be taken seriously as a native Russian breed in the 1950s, and grew in popularity. Export of the dogs was strictly regulated. In 1978 a breeding pair of Franzuskaya Bolonka was sent as a diplomatic gift from the Soviet Union into the GDR. From these and a few others, the white Franzuskaya Bolonka began to be developed as a breed in Germany in the 1980s. Eventually it was recognized by the VDF (Verband fr das Deutsche Hundewesen) as a variation of the Italian Bolognese.

The Kunming wolfdog was created in the early 1950s to meet the need for military dogs in Yunnan. A group of ten shepherd type dogs mixed with unknown breeds were brought to Kunming from a military K9 training program in Beijing in 1953. These ten dogs were insufficient for the immediate need, and so fifty suitable household dogs from Kunming were recruited as well as forty similar dogs from the city of Guiyang in Guizhou province (like the first ten, the exact breeds of these dogs are unknown other than that they were crossbreeds).

Species who previously had needed to be small and hide as a way of life suddenly had the requirement released and there was a strong pressure to get big and successful. The Paleocene was a period of struggle in which  animals that had been occupied with avoiding being eaten by dominant species, namely the dinosaurs, were suddenly competing against each other to become the next dominant organism. Most mammals were small, many the size of rabbits, few exceeding the size of cats. The competition between the two groups of predatory mammals, the creodonts and the Carnivoramorpha, resulted in the better adapted creodonts occupying the position of top predators. As the Eocene continued, they were the dominant hunters and the carnivorans remained relatively small, staying out of the way. Miacis lived during this period. Miacis belongs to the stem-group Carnivoramorpha that began to diversify during the middle and late Oligocene. Two major lineages appeared, the feliformes (cats, hyenas, civets, palm civets, etc.) and the caniformes (dogs, bears, pinnipeds, skunks, ferrets, etc.). The tables began to turn and the creodonts were struggling during the late Oligocene when the carnivorans, while small, were well off. Open niches left by extinct predators were quickly filled by the small carnivorans, and they became larger and more diverse until their peak in the Miocene when the last of the creodonts had died out.",CAR_d04a381f0814ef3de34e6f07ffa1b65fccbd00e8,0,,

Domesticated dogs are clearly distinguishable from wolves by starch gel electrophoresis of red blood cell acid phosphatase. The tympanic bullae are large, convex and almost spherical in gray wolves, while the bullae of dogs are smaller, compressed and slightly crumpled. Compared to equally sized wolves, dogs tend to have 20% smaller skulls and 30% smaller brains. The teeth of gray wolves are also proportionately larger than those of dogs. Compared to wolves, dogs have a more domed forehead. The temporalis muscle that closes the jaws is more robust in wolves. Wolves do not have dewclaws on their back legs, unless there has been admixture with dogs that had them. Dogs lack a functioning pre-caudal gland, and most enter estrus twice yearly, unlike gray wolves which only do so once a year. Dogs require fewer calories to function than wolves. The dog's limp ears may be the result of atrophy of the jaw muscles. The skin of domestic dogs tends to be thicker than that of wolves, with some Inuit tribes favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather. The paws of a dog are half the size of those of a wolf, and their tails tend to curl upwards, another trait not found in wolves The dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal. For example, height measured to the withers ranges from a  in the Chihuahua to  in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called blue) to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark (red or chocolate) in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth.

In harsh Siberian conditions they reveal their stamina; they tend to work in small groups and can work through the whole day, from dawn to sunset. Popularity of dog sledding appeared with the arrival of Russian traders to the Arctic. With the increased demand for white polar foxes in the 17th century, the Arctic exploration received its spike. Furs and mammoth tusks trade became local nations main income. Origin and subsequent formation of the breed are still not quite known, but because of the hard to access country and extreme natural conditions, Yakutian Laikas have lived as primitive aboriginal breeds; they were rarely confined and mated free. Naturally, local type dogs could be preserved only under conditions of complete isolation from dogs of other breeds. First scientific descriptions of dogs of Yakutia were published in late 18th century, when first geographic studies of the north were conducted. Prince Shirinsky-Shikhmatov wrote in his monograph about Laikas: Researchers of the north, of course, could not overlook northern dog; they could not disagree with hard fact that presence of this dog makes life of northern people possible. It is even more strange that so little attention was paid to description of dogs of the north; their ancestral aboriginal type and numerous varieties remain obscure. There are as many types of Laikas as ethnic minorities of the north; varieties of Laikas differ clearly from each other, each has its own peculiarities and their division is indisputable. This monograph was written in 1898. Russian Geographic Society gave task to Mr. Maak to investigate Vilyuisk District. Review of Vilyuiks District of Yakutian Provionce was published in 1877.

He wrote: even most poor Yakut having no other animals, has at least one dog. Yokhelson (Johelson?), 1898, in his publication Hunting Industry in Kolyma Territory of Yakutian Province and described the Tungus Lajka used for sledding and hunting dogs. He wrote: There are two breeds of dogs, one is so-called Tungus Laika, a pointed-eared dog of nomadic reindeer herders and polar sled dog. All researchers described dogs of Yakutia as one breed of polar sled dogs. Yokhelson wrote: Sled dog is a burden animal not only of nomads living in not forested country, but also of settled near the river Russians and russified minorities and the dog of majority of cattle keeping Yakuts.

The commands were selected to provide control over the dog, and included heel, stand go, come, hold, drop and sit. These behaviors were termed safety behaviors. Training was divided into 9 stages, each of which was composed of 5-20 twice daily training sessions. Dogs could only progress to the next stage after passing a test. On average, dogs took 10-15 sessions to complete each stage. After training basic commands, the dogs were trained to perform the behaviors they had already learned in order to avoid progressively increasing electric shock. After that, they were conditioned to perform a safety behavior in order to avoid a safety tone that allowed them to anticipate the shock. In the later stages of training, dogs were exposed to provocation by a distractor dog, and were punished using full intensity shock if they failed to perform a safety behavior or if they showed aggression. After training was complete, and the dogs were choosing to perform the safety behaviors instead of aggression, owners were taught to use the shock collar and the training was transferred into everyday situations. The training resulted in a long-lasting and complete suppression of aggressive behaviour in the dogs.

The dogs are born in the Whelping Kennel facility of Guiding Eyes for the Blind (GEB), which is located in Patterson, NY. Here, trained volunteers begin the very first and most important part of a guide dogs training: socialization. The first 9 weeks of a GEB guide dog consists of exposure to various environments and experiences to help with their emotional, as well as intellectual development. By simply interacting with the dogs on a daily basis, these trained volunteers help foster the important bond that must be present between a guide dog and hisher human companion. In addition, these volunteers (or socializers) are also trained in puppy massage techniques that not only help the dogs become familiar with being handled, but also improve the dogs health and help enhance their development. Aside from these socialization procedures, the dogs are also taught a few basic commands and basic guide dog etiquettes that are important to learn early on. The first command every guide dog in GEB learns is sit. It is a simple command and fairly natural for the dog to do, and so it is taught to them very early on. The other things that are taught are crate etiquette and bathroom etiquette (which is referred to as get busy). The socializers introduce the dogs to the crate early on so that they are familiar with it. The reason for this is because oftentimes the dogs will spend a lot of time in the crate, and it is important for them to behave themselves while in there.

Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that it is a good idea to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors.

In 1967 Esther Ekman met Chris Smith-Risk at an AKC show, and the two fell into conversation about their Australian Cattle Dogs and the process of establishing a parent club for the breed. By 1969 the fledgling club had 12 members and formally applied to the AKC for instructions. One of the requirements was that the Club had to start keeping its own registry for the breed and that all dogs on the registry would have to be an extension of the Australian registry, tracing back to registered dogs in Australia. The AKC Parent Club members began researching their dogs, including exchanging correspondence with McNiven, and discovered that few of them had dogs that could be traced back to dogs registered in Australia. The AKC took over the club registry in 1979 and the breed was fully recognised in September 1980. The Australian Cattle Dog Club of America is still active in the promotion of the breed and the maintenance of breed standards.

After WWII, the increasing complexities of suburban living demanded that for a pet dog's own protection and its owner's convenience, the dog should be obedient. William Koehler had served as principal trainer at the War Dog Training Center, in California, and after the war became chief trainer for the Orange Empire Dog Clubat the time, the largest dog club in the United Statesinstructor for a number of breed clubs, and a dog trainer for the Walt Disney Studios. In 1962 Koehler published The Koehler Method of Dog Training, in which he is highly critical of what he calls tid-bit training techniques based in the prattle of 'dog psychologists'. Amongst the training innovations attributed to Koehler is the use of a long line in conjunction with a complete absence of oral communication as a way of instilling attentiveness prior to any leash training. Koehler insisted that participants in his training classes used emphatic corrections, including leash jerks and throw chains, explaining that tentative, nagging corrections were cruel in that they caused emotional disturbance to the dog. Vicki Hearne, a disciple of Koehler's, commented on the widespread criticism of his corrections, with the explanation that it was the emotionally loaded language used in the book that led to a number of court cases, and to the book being banned in Arizona for a time.

Louis IV of France presented the Bolonka as gifts to Russian nobility. Later, the ancestors of the Russian Tsvetnaya Bolonka migrated to Russia with Napoleons army and they were known as the French Bolonka. Russia was never known for its toy breeds, partly because of its environment and its economic need for working dogs. Smaller breeds were considered superfluous and unnecessary, even more so during the Soviet Regime. During this time, dogs were not imported to Russia, so breeds were developed by selections from existing breeds. Being unable to import dogs from outside of Russia, the Bolonka was developed by localized breeding through dog lovers in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, who looked to the ancestors of smaller dogs such as the Bichon, Toy Poodle, Shih Tzu, Pekingese and French Bolognese, with a view to creating a toy sized lap dog that would have the right temperament for apartment living. Since 1966, they have been called Russian Tsvetnaya Bolonka. Interest in the specific breed of Bolonka revived after the fall of the Iron Curtain.Similarly, through the connection between the Russian and French aristocracy in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a dog similar to the Bichon Fris or Bolognese of today was brought to Tsarist Russia. These little white dogs were favorites of the fashionable ladies of the period in both countries. After the Russian Revolution, the breed was isolated from the French dogs. The little dogs began to be taken seriously as a native Russian breed in the 1950s, and grew in popularity. Export of the dogs was strictly regulated. In 1978 a breeding pair of Franzuskaya Bolonka was sent as a diplomatic gift from the Soviet Union into the GDR. From these and a few others, the white Franzuskaya Bolonka began to be developed as a breed in Germany in the 1980s. Eventually it was recognized by the VDF (Verband fr das Deutsche Hundewesen) as a variation of the Italian Bolognese. This was at the same time as the coloured version was being developed, the Bolonka Zwetnaya (bunte Schohndchen, Tsvetnaya Bolonka, Deutscher Bolonka).

These raisers go through specific GEB screening as well as training so that they can properly aide the dogs in their next step to becoming a guide dog. During this time period, the dogs go through training that could be classified as extended socialization. What happens is the puppy raisers take the dog home and teach them how a guide dog is supposed to interact with the outside world. At this time, more commands are introduced and as the dog learns them, heshe gets closer and closer to becoming a full-fledged guide dog. Some of these other commands include: stand, down, stay, touch, back, heel and close (among others). However, its not enough for the dogs to simply perform these tasks. There are distractions everywhere and the dogs must learn to keep calm and obey hisher master in all situations. During this time the dogs learn how to greet other people and how to interact with different social settings. The raisers are encouraged to take the dogs to as many different places as they can to introduce them to new experiences, as long as the dog is ready them. One of the important things during this training time is to make sure not to ask too much of the dog. The raiser wants the dog to be successful, so it is important not to go too fast with the training procedures. To keep track of a dogs progress as well as their training and their raisers, GEB has puppy classes for the raiserdog pairs. At these classes, the training methods are enforced and the raiser and dog get to practice the commands in a controlled environment. This is one of the ways that GEB supports its puppy raisers and offers advice and feedback to help the process be as productive and as fun as possible. GEB also provides veterinary care for the dogs without cost to the raiser. Another set of volunteers that are involved in a dogs life at this point and time are called Puppy Sitters. Puppy Sitters are just like raisers in many ways. They go through the same training and oftentimes attend the puppy classes as well. The only difference is that they dont keep the dog with them for a year and-a-half. A puppy sitter will often take one of the puppies for a period of time and expose the puppy to hisher social group, which is often different from that of the puppy raiser. This way, the dogs get a wider variety of exposure to different things.",CAR_ac997610b10deae80bbc5a34a2bca8899292b494,0,,

During the initial fitness period, the target of the training has a base level of fitness (shown by the first time sector in the graph). Upon entering the training period, the target's level of fitness decreases (shown by the second time sector in the graph).  After training, the body enters the recovery period during which level of fitness increases up to the initial fitness level (shown by the third time sector in the graph).  Because the human body is an adjustable organism, it will feel the need to adjust itself to a higher level of fitness in anticipation of the next training session. Accordingly, the increase in fitness following a training session does not stop at the initial fitness level.  Instead the body enters a period of supercompensation during which fitness surpasses the initial fitness level (shown by the fourth time sector in the graph).

The Kunming wolfdog was created in the early 1950s to meet the need for military dogs in Yunnan. A group of ten shepherd type dogs mixed with unknown breeds were brought to Kunming from a military K9 training program in Beijing in 1953. These ten dogs were insufficient for the immediate need, and so fifty suitable household dogs from Kunming were recruited as well as forty similar dogs from the city of Guiyang in Guizhou province (like the first ten, the exact breeds of these dogs are unknown other than that they were crossbreeds). After training, the best twenty of these ninety dogs were then selected. Ten wolfdogs bred in Beijing, twenty 'civil dogs' plus an additional ten 'shepherd dogs' imported from East Germany were added to the pool from which the Kunming Dog was developed.

When the war began, men were called up for only one month's additional training. This was then increased to three months' additional training. In 194041, officers and non-commissioned officers were intensively trained for 18 to 24 days, after which there was a camp for 70 days. Meanwhile, soldiers who had been through the 90-day training regimen in 193940 were given 12 days' additional training, while those who had not completed this training undertook 70 days. This allowed for individual training, but prevented proper unit training. In July 1941, fully trained soldiers who had completed 90 days' training became liable for three months' additional training per year while new recruits were liable for six months. At the same time, the War Cabinet provided for more intensive training for the full-time cadre of Militia units, which were not to exceed 25 percent of the unit's strength. Training for the Militia and the VDC was also hampered in the early war years by a lack of small arms, particularly after the Dunkirk evacuation when Australia dispatched its reserve stock of rifles to Britain, in an effort to help replace equipment lost  by the British Army, amidst concerns of an invasion of the United Kingdom after the Fall of France.",CAR_d68616a2d9c14ab417418394eecbfdd6ba83c78c,0," The Kuvasz is an intelligent dog and is often described as having a clownish sense of humor which can last throughout their adolescence and into adulthood. They are intensely loyal and patient pets who appreciate attention but may also be somewhat aloof or independent, as well as thoroughly cunning, particularly with strangers. They rank a low 42nd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, but keep in mind that Coren's criteria focus on how fast a dog can learn obedience tricksa limited test of intelligence. The kuvasz breed is for experienced handlers only. The combination of intelligence, independence and protectiveness make obedience training and socialization absolute necessities. They are strictly working dogs, bred for centuries to think independently and act without instruction, scanning and evaluating the environment and taking protective or deterrent action as needed. This was a vital trait in their solitary duties protecting livestock. That independence can make training a difficult task, wearing on the patience of even experienced owners. Kuvasz quickly understand what is being asked of them, but they have to respect a person as a trusted leader before they'll obey commands. They're also not usually interested in meaningless activity, such as doing entertaining tricks. As a result, they are not recommended for novices and those who do not have time to train and socialize them properly. An adolescent Kuvasz should be able to learn basic obedience commands and consistently respond to them; however the instinctive need to investigate strangers and protect its owner may cause the Kuvasz to act independently when off leash and ignore the calls of a frustrated handler. Interactions with other dogs, especially first meetings, should be managed carefully. One of the tasks of a livestock guardian is to kill wolves, coyotes, and other predators, and this instinct remains intact in the modern dog. Handlers should be alert to signs of tension, and intervene before a dangerous situation develops. However, a well socialized, well trained kuvasz will usually ignore, play with, or go exploring with other dogs once a successful introduction has been made.Finally, a potential owner should refrain from purchasing a Kuvasz if barking will be a problem at the home. While not every Kuvasz is prone to barking (socializing them will define what is a threat), many of them fulfill their guardian role by vocally warning off potential threats, both real and imagined. On the other hand, many of these qualities make the Kuvasz excellent guardians for sheep or large estates. The Kuvasz has a very special, close connection to his owner or family, as well as anyone in their circle, human or animal. that the dog considers part of the flock. He will protect all of them. He may also police interactions among them, such as discouraging rough play by herding rowdy individuals away from the group. The owner has the responsibility for setting clear, consistent limits on this behavior. That connection can easily be lost if the dog is humiliated, confused by contradictory commands, or otherwise abused. If abuse persists, the owner can expect to be either run away from or dealt with.",CAR_da7ac33e0dfc51b1f31f5d7c7933ab279834a83f,0," Dachshunds are statistically more aggressive to both strangers and other dogs.

In harsh Siberian conditions they reveal their stamina; they tend to work in small groups and can work through the whole day, from dawn to sunset. Popularity of dog sledding appeared with the arrival of Russian traders to the Arctic. With the increased demand for white polar foxes in the 17th century, the Arctic exploration received its spike. Furs and mammoth tusks trade became local nations main income. Origin and subsequent formation of the breed are still not quite known, but because of the hard to access country and extreme natural conditions, Yakutian Laikas have lived as primitive aboriginal breeds; they were rarely confined and mated free. Naturally, local type dogs could be preserved only under conditions of complete isolation from dogs of other breeds. First scientific descriptions of dogs of Yakutia were published in late 18th century, when first geographic studies of the north were conducted. Prince Shirinsky-Shikhmatov wrote in his monograph about Laikas: Researchers of the north, of course, could not overlook northern dog; they could not disagree with hard fact that presence of this dog makes life of northern people possible. It is even more strange that so little attention was paid to description of dogs of the north; their ancestral aboriginal type and numerous varieties remain obscure. There are as many types of Laikas as ethnic minorities of the north; varieties of Laikas differ clearly from each other, each has its own peculiarities and their division is indisputable. This monograph was written in 1898. Russian Geographic Society gave task to Mr. Maak to investigate Vilyuisk District. Review of Vilyuiks District of Yakutian Provionce was published in 1877. Maak wrote: I saw dog of very typical appearance and very common in Siberia, which was fox-like. In 1896, V. L. Seroshevsky published a book Yakuts, edited by N. I. Veselovsky. Describing dogs of Yakuts, Seroshevsky divides them into two groups, 1) guarding and hunting dogs and 2) maritime sled dogs. He wrote: even most poor Yakut having no other animals, has at least one dog. Yokhelson (Johelson?), 1898, in his publication Hunting Industry in Kolyma Territory of Yakutian Province and described the Tungus Lajka used for sledding and hunting dogs. He wrote: There are two breeds of dogs, one is so-called Tungus Laika, a pointed-eared dog of nomadic reindeer herders and polar sled dog. All researchers described dogs of Yakutia as one breed of polar sled dogs. Yokhelson wrote: Sled dog is a burden animal not only of nomads living in not forested country, but also of settled near the river Russians and russified minorities and the dog of majority of cattle keeping Yakuts. Except southwestern part of the territory, one can find 5-6 dogs in every yurta, which are used for hauling firewood and other works needed by the household. The polar dog is not big, 50-60 cm at the shoulder In the appearance, with his prick ears, oblique set eyes, thick coat and broad massive head, pointed muzzle, low carried tail (when the dog is tired, eats or in a bad mood), the dog is very similar to wolf. Among them, there are shaggy dogs, and somewhat blunt muzzle not different from our Spitzes  Generally, type of Kolyma sled dog is diverse and, perhaps, it is a mix between Kamchatka and Eskimo sled dogs with another imported breed. It stands to a reason that other dogs relocated here together with new immigrants. Both Seroshevsky and Yokhelson described the Yakutian Sled Dog similarly: Legs relatively thick and short, chest, which is used to pull sleds, perfectly developed; neck is thick and short. Face is unusually intelligent and with melancholic or grim expression.

At the same time, theyve got kind character and are very faithful to people. Yakutian Laikas are not demanding to conditions of life and easily endure the hostile climate of northern Siberia. In harsh Siberian conditions they reveal their stamina; they tend to work in small groups and can work through the whole day, from dawn to sunset. Popularity of dog sledding appeared with the arrival of Russian traders to the Arctic. With the increased demand for white polar foxes in the 17th century, the Arctic exploration received its spike. Furs and mammoth tusks trade became local nations main income. Origin and subsequent formation of the breed are still not quite known, but because of the hard to access country and extreme natural conditions, Yakutian Laikas have lived as primitive aboriginal breeds; they were rarely confined and mated free. Naturally, local type dogs could be preserved only under conditions of complete isolation from dogs of other breeds. First scientific descriptions of dogs of Yakutia were published in late 18th century, when first geographic studies of the north were conducted. Prince Shirinsky-Shikhmatov wrote in his monograph about Laikas: Researchers of the north, of course, could not overlook northern dog; they could not disagree with hard fact that presence of this dog makes life of northern people possible. It is even more strange that so little attention was paid to description of dogs of the north; their ancestral aboriginal type and numerous varieties remain obscure. There are as many types of Laikas as ethnic minorities of the north; varieties of Laikas differ clearly from each other, each has its own peculiarities and their division is indisputable. This monograph was written in 1898. Russian Geographic Society gave task to Mr. Maak to investigate Vilyuisk District. Review of Vilyuiks District of Yakutian Provionce was published in 1877. Maak wrote: I saw dog of very typical appearance and very common in Siberia, which was fox-like. In 1896, V. L. Seroshevsky published a book Yakuts, edited by N. I. Veselovsky. Describing dogs of Yakuts, Seroshevsky divides them into two groups, 1) guarding and hunting dogs and 2) maritime sled dogs. He wrote: even most poor Yakut having no other animals, has at least one dog. Yokhelson (Johelson?), 1898, in his publication Hunting Industry in Kolyma Territory of Yakutian Province and described the Tungus Lajka used for sledding and hunting dogs. He wrote: There are two breeds of dogs, one is so-called Tungus Laika, a pointed-eared dog of nomadic reindeer herders and polar sled dog. All researchers described dogs of Yakutia as one breed of polar sled dogs. Yokhelson wrote: Sled dog is a burden animal not only of nomads living in not forested country, but also of settled near the river Russians and russified minorities and the dog of majority of cattle keeping Yakuts. Except southwestern part of the territory, one can find 5-6 dogs in every yurta, which are used for hauling firewood and other works needed by the household. The polar dog is not big, 50-60 cm at the shoulder In the appearance, with his prick ears, oblique set eyes, thick coat and broad massive head, pointed muzzle, low carried tail (when the dog is tired, eats or in a bad mood), the dog is very similar to wolf. Among them, there are shaggy dogs, and somewhat blunt muzzle not different from our Spitzes  Generally, type of Kolyma sled dog is diverse and, perhaps, it is a mix between Kamchatka and Eskimo sled dogs with another imported breed. It stands to a reason that other dogs relocated here together with new immigrants. Both Seroshevsky and Yokhelson described the Yakutian Sled Dog similarly: Legs relatively thick and short, chest, which is used to pull sleds, perfectly developed; neck is thick and short.

An Irish wolfhound, however, is rarely mindless, and despite its large size is rarely found to be destructive in the house or boisterous. This is because the breed is generally introverted, intelligent, and reserved in character. An easygoing animal, the Irish Wolfhound is quiet by nature. Wolfhounds often create a strong bond with their family and can become quite destructive or morose if left alone for long periods of time. An Irish wolfhound is not a guard dog and will protect individuals rather than the house or the owners possessions. However independent the wolfhound is, the breed becomes attached to both owners and other dogs they are raised with and is therefore not the most adaptable of breeds. Bred for independence, an Irish wolfhound is not necessarily keen on defending spaces. A wolfhound is most easily described by its historical motto, gentle when stroked, fierce when provoked.   Despite the need for their own people, Wolfhounds generally are somewhat stand-offish with total strangers. They should not be territorially aggressive to other domestic dogs but are born with specialized skills and it is common for hounds at play to course another dog. This is a specific hunting behavior, not a fighting or territorial domination behavior. Most Wolfhounds are very gentle with children. The Irish Wolfhound is relatively easy to train. They respond well to firm, but gentle, consistent leadership. However, historically these dogs were required to work at great distances from their masters and think independently when hunting rather than waiting for detailed commands and this can still be seen in the breed.",CAR_4497362e01c0482b9604cdb78316c85709730874,0," Each element of the standard is considered both independently and part of the whole of breed type.

All landrace breeds of animals share a certain appearance, but never with the modern concept of breeds.  The modern understanding of dog breeds is based on the eugenics programs promoted by the kennel clubs. Collie dogs were the poor man's dog, the shepherd, the drover, the farmer and the highlander. All men who carried the stewardship of their animals proudly. Their dogs (unlike the hunting dogs of the rich), had to be hardy enough to survive on very little and require little special handling.

These dogs may be registered with breed club. The breed clubs may be an open stud book or a closed stud book, the term can be interpreted to either. Usually the breed club is also associated with a kennel club (AKC, UKC, CKC etc.). However dogs who are registered with a breed club are usually referred to as registered. Some use the term exclusively for a dog that has also been registered with a breed club, but more often it is used simply as a generic term to refer to dogs who have known pedigrees within a standardized breed. A dog that is purebred cannot be interpreted to mean it is high-quality dog. It is no reflection on the quality of the dog's health, temperament or sagacity, but merely a reference that the dog has known parentage according to the breeder. While some breed clubs can now guarantee parentage through DNA testing for the most part all breed clubs must rely exclusively on the breeder's word and choice of parentage. In the early years of the kennel club concept this was not at issue since dog breeding was only done among the extremely wealthy and their reputations were at stake. However in this modern age of breeding one must be aware that even a DNA proven purebred and registered champion who has won national competitions can have serious health issues.

Alexander L. White (1860-1942) liked the little dog and took it home. After the dog showed some aptitude for retrieving, White sent the dog called Dumpy to his longtime friend and hunting partner Lemuel Whitaker Boykin near Camden, South Carolina.  Whit Boykin (18611932) experimented with crossbreeding different breeds, and the resulting dog is named after him. In Boykin's hands the little stray developed into a superb turkey dog and waterfowl retriever. This dog became the foundation stock for the Boykin spaniel.  The dogs had to be small enough to ride in the small boats used by hunters in the swamps. The Chesapeake Bay Retriever, Springer Spaniel, Cocker Spaniel, and the American Water Spaniel may have been used in the development of the breed. The area in which the breed developed, around Camden, South Carolina, was a resort area, and the breed was noticed by visitors and so spread around the United States.  The Boykin Spaniel Society was formed in 1977 and began maintaining a studbook  in 1979. The BSS studbook has been closed since 1982, meaning that only dogs from BSS registered parents may be registered with the BSS.The Boykin Spaniel was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1985. UKC does not close its studbooks so dogs from the BSS or the AKC may be registered into the UKC studbook at any time. In the 1990s a group of fanciers formed the Boykin Spaniel Club And Breeders Association of America in order to achieve AKC recognition of the breed and to gain access to the AKC Spaniel Hunt Tests and AKC Spaniel Field Trials held throughout the nation. The BSCBAA was the first Boykin Spaniel organization to form and maintain a Code of Ethics.

In purebred dogs, intentionally breeding dogs of very similar appearance over several generations produces animals that carry many of the same alleles, some of which are detrimental. If the founding population for the breed was small, then the genetic diversity of that particular breed may be small for quite some time. In essence, when humans select certain dogs for new breeds, they artificially isolate that group of genes and cause more copies of that gene to be made than might have otherwise occurred in nature. Initially, the population will be more fragile because of the lack of genetic diversity. If the dog breed is popular, and the line continues, over hundreds of years diversity will increase due to mutations and occasional out-breeding; like an island with a few new birdsthey will diversify. This is why some of the very old breeds are more stable. The problem is when certain traits found in the breed standard are associated with genetic disorders. Then, the artificial selective force favors the duplication of the genetic disorder, because it comes with a desired physical trait. The genetic health of hybrids tends to be higher. Healthy traits have been lost in many purebred dogs lines because many breeders of showdogs are more interested in conformation  the physical attributes of the dogs in relation to the breed standard  than in the health and working temperament for which the dog was originally bred.",CAR_9ed942541372c13b7b77f1b1fb7a401ee1cd8de9,0," Summary of the 20 April 2013 Basra governorate election results- style=background-color:#E9E9E9!align=left colspan=2 valign=topPartyCoalition!!

Louis IV of France presented the Bolonka as gifts to Russian nobility. Later, the ancestors of the Russian Tsvetnaya Bolonka migrated to Russia with Napoleons army and they were known as the French Bolonka. Russia was never known for its toy breeds, partly because of its environment and its economic need for working dogs. Smaller breeds were considered superfluous and unnecessary, even more so during the Soviet Regime. During this time, dogs were not imported to Russia, so breeds were developed by selections from existing breeds. Being unable to import dogs from outside of Russia, the Bolonka was developed by localized breeding through dog lovers in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, who looked to the ancestors of smaller dogs such as the Bichon, Toy Poodle, Shih Tzu, Pekingese and French Bolognese, with a view to creating a toy sized lap dog that would have the right temperament for apartment living. Since 1966, they have been called Russian Tsvetnaya Bolonka. Interest in the specific breed of Bolonka revived after the fall of the Iron Curtain.Similarly, through the connection between the Russian and French aristocracy in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a dog similar to the Bichon Fris or Bolognese of today was brought to Tsarist Russia. These little white dogs were favorites of the fashionable ladies of the period in both countries. After the Russian Revolution, the breed was isolated from the French dogs. The little dogs began to be taken seriously as a native Russian breed in the 1950s, and grew in popularity. Export of the dogs was strictly regulated. In 1978 a breeding pair of Franzuskaya Bolonka was sent as a diplomatic gift from the Soviet Union into the GDR. From these and a few others, the white Franzuskaya Bolonka began to be developed as a breed in Germany in the 1980s. Eventually it was recognized by the VDF (Verband fr das Deutsche Hundewesen) as a variation of the Italian Bolognese.

Once all preliminaries and finals have been run, Best of Breed is determined for each breed by stakes run-off or by forfeit. All placements must be determined by total score (preliminary + final), run-off, or forfeit.  After the Best of Breed runs, the top dogs from each breed compete for Best in Field to determine the best hound for the trial. Some clubs opt to provide a Best in Event which brings Best of Breed dogs from multiple days to run off.  In AKC trials, Italian Greyhounds are not permitted to compete for Best In Field.  This is because Italian Greyhounds have been known to be mistaken as prey by the larger sighthound breeds.",CAR_cfa3005c594889064f71d92826318d78d6d9962b,0," ID@Xbox (Independent Developers @ Xbox) is a program by Microsoft allowing independent video game developers to self-publish titles for Windows and the Xbox One home video game console.",CAR_d03719abad865853c11123597ad1955bf5fe17f7,0," The Karakachan dog is a very ancient breed of livestock guarding dog. It originate from the shepherd dogs of theancient Thracians and Asian Livestock guardian dogs of the proto-Bulgarians. Karakachan people had bred thisdog conservatively and had formed its present type. Due to its perfect working qualities this breed has beenwidely used by shepherds in Bulgaria.Similarly to the above two breeds, the socialist regime almost manages to annihilate the Karakachan dog.Up to day the government has not supported the breed survival in any way, except including it in the Red DataList of the autochthonic forms of domestic animals as a disappearing breed (or critical).Semperviva started the work for saving the Karakachan dog in 1992. Since the beginning a breeding stationhas been established, where the breeding process is made on the base of aboriginal dogs. A breed standard anda herd book were worked out. An International Karakachan Dog Association was founded. Semperviva hasalways aimed to save this breed as a working dog with its original qualities. In this aspect, since 1997, incooperation with the Balkani Wildlife Society, dogs have been provided to livestock breeders for protection of their flocks against predators. In this way it is aimed to decrease the conflict between people and large carnivores (wolves and bears) and to restore the breed in its natural environment. This particular project has been supported by several foundations in different years of its implementation: European Natural Heritage Fund  Euronatur, GzSW, UK Wolf Conservation Trust and Alertis. Thanks to these activities there is a slight trend of increase of working dogs. The three breeds, subject of the project have been selected by Karakachan people, which are ancient, autochthonic, ethnic group of nomad livestock breeders. The three breeds, which are one of the oldest in Europe, had been numerous in Bulgaria before the nationalization of the private property during the socialist regime. As a consequence of that time politics in the farming practice, these breeds have been massively crossbred with foreign more productive ones and also huge numbers of them have been exterminated without control. All this have brought these karakachan breeds to the edge of extinction. In addition, nowadays the mountain livestock breeding is a losing practice.

They are very social dogs if trained properly. The BMC is an extremely smart breed who by nature need to bond a few weeks with their ownertrainer before training can begin.  They are also very sensitive dogs that are very attune to their master's voice and should never be yelled at in anger or spanked.  BMC's make good family dogs as long as they have access to at least an acre of yard and can access it throughout the day.  This dog will not be happy spending the day on the couch alone. They are very social dogs and need a human companion and daily routines where they are allowed to sprint.  These are not couch dogs and must have access to several hours of exercise daily to avoid anxiety and depression.   The BMC was bred as a homestead dog that would protect its family and home against intruders. This means that a well-bred BMC is territorial. Most BMCs off their 'turf' work well with other dogs, hunting or herding stock, but on their family property will chase the same dog away. Their turf can be viewed by the dog as the familys home, land, truck, or sometimes proximity to 'their person'.",CAR_dd7a5e85500854eb0f5a9dc936099c80e06ea025,0," Kennel clubs provide the recognition of distinct dog breeds, but there are many independent clubs with differing, and sometime inconsistent standards and they need not apply scientific standards.

It is smart and can be easily trained. It is best to train this dog at a young age, because some habits will stick as they become older. However, training these dogs while they are older is still possible. Like many toy breeds, the Havanese can be difficult to housebreak. However, Havanese can be trained to use a litter box, which can greatly reduce issues with housebreaking. This breed is very smart and can be house trained faster than most toy dogs. The Havanese get very attached and are very loyal to their owners, and often attach to one person which they will closely follow. As a result, the Havanese does not do well in a household where it will be left alone all day. Although the Havanese is an active and lively dog, they are small enough that many of their exercise needs can be met in a house or yard, and therefore they do not require as much vigorous exercise as other breeds may. However, exercise is still necessary for this breed to be happy and healthy.

This athletic, healthy and long-lived breed has been bred to be intelligent, calm, gentle, and fearless. Adults are typically suspicious of strangers and are excellent natural guard dogs. On the other hand, they typically take their cue from their handlers when it comes to greeting strangers, and are neither sharp nor shy. They do best when raised within the family but they can sleep outside, the better to act as guards (their weatherproof coats make them ideal kennel users even in the coldest winters). They are eager learners and can be trained to a high level. However, their physical and mental development is slow, relative to other similar breeds (e.g. German and other large shepherds): they are not mentally or physically mature until the age of about three years, so their training should not be rushed.

For this reason, many working and hunting dog owners will not join breed clubs associated with national kennel clubs, preferring to maintain their breeds and stud books independently. A disadvantage to this approach is the loss of access to the many events and activities that the national clubs can afford to sponsor.

An Irish wolfhound, however, is rarely mindless, and despite its large size is rarely found to be destructive in the house or boisterous. This is because the breed is generally introverted, intelligent, and reserved in character. An easygoing animal, the Irish Wolfhound is quiet by nature. Wolfhounds often create a strong bond with their family and can become quite destructive or morose if left alone for long periods of time. An Irish wolfhound is not a guard dog and will protect individuals rather than the house or the owners possessions. However independent the wolfhound is, the breed becomes attached to both owners and other dogs they are raised with and is therefore not the most adaptable of breeds. Bred for independence, an Irish wolfhound is not necessarily keen on defending spaces. A wolfhound is most easily described by its historical motto, gentle when stroked, fierce when provoked.   Despite the need for their own people, Wolfhounds generally are somewhat stand-offish with total strangers. They should not be territorially aggressive to other domestic dogs but are born with specialized skills and it is common for hounds at play to course another dog. This is a specific hunting behavior, not a fighting or territorial domination behavior. Most Wolfhounds are very gentle with children. The Irish Wolfhound is relatively easy to train. They respond well to firm, but gentle, consistent leadership. However, historically these dogs were required to work at great distances from their masters and think independently when hunting rather than waiting for detailed commands and this can still be seen in the breed.",CAR_4497362e01c0482b9604cdb78316c85709730874,0," The Wheaten was bred in Ireland for over two hundred years to be an all-purpose farm dog whose duties included herding, watching and guarding livestock, and vermin hunting and killing.

Dogs can run alone if there are no other dogs of the same breed entered, but their scores will not qualify towards a title unless they defeat a hound in a Best of Breed run.  Running order is determined by a random draw, and is not based on size or comparable ability. Dogs can compete in open stake, field champion stake (for dogs who have earned the requisite points), or veteran stake (dogs over the age of 6 years, except Irish Wolfhounds (5 years), and Whippets (7 years)). Each dog runs twice during the trial.  The first run is the preliminary.  After all preliminaries have been run, the course is reversed for the second run, called finals.  Once all preliminaries and finals have been run, Best of Breed is determined for each breed by stakes run-off or by forfeit. All placements must be determined by total score (preliminary + final), run-off, or forfeit.  After the Best of Breed runs, the top dogs from each breed compete for Best in Field to determine the best hound for the trial. Some clubs opt to provide a Best in Event which brings Best of Breed dogs from multiple days to run off.  In AKC trials, Italian Greyhounds are not permitted to compete for Best In Field.

Domesticated dogs are clearly distinguishable from wolves by starch gel electrophoresis of red blood cell acid phosphatase. The tympanic bullae are large, convex and almost spherical in gray wolves, while the bullae of dogs are smaller, compressed and slightly crumpled. Compared to equally sized wolves, dogs tend to have 20% smaller skulls and 30% smaller brains. The teeth of gray wolves are also proportionately larger than those of dogs. Compared to wolves, dogs have a more domed forehead. The temporalis muscle that closes the jaws is more robust in wolves. Wolves do not have dewclaws on their back legs, unless there has been admixture with dogs that had them. Dogs lack a functioning pre-caudal gland, and most enter estrus twice yearly, unlike gray wolves which only do so once a year. Dogs require fewer calories to function than wolves. The dog's limp ears may be the result of atrophy of the jaw muscles. The skin of domestic dogs tends to be thicker than that of wolves, with some Inuit tribes favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather. The paws of a dog are half the size of those of a wolf, and their tails tend to curl upwards, another trait not found in wolves The dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal. For example, height measured to the withers ranges from a  in the Chihuahua to  in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called blue) to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark (red or chocolate) in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth.

An Irish wolfhound, however, is rarely mindless, and despite its large size is rarely found to be destructive in the house or boisterous. This is because the breed is generally introverted, intelligent, and reserved in character. An easygoing animal, the Irish Wolfhound is quiet by nature. Wolfhounds often create a strong bond with their family and can become quite destructive or morose if left alone for long periods of time. An Irish wolfhound is not a guard dog and will protect individuals rather than the house or the owners possessions. However independent the wolfhound is, the breed becomes attached to both owners and other dogs they are raised with and is therefore not the most adaptable of breeds. Bred for independence, an Irish wolfhound is not necessarily keen on defending spaces. A wolfhound is most easily described by its historical motto, gentle when stroked, fierce when provoked.   Despite the need for their own people, Wolfhounds generally are somewhat stand-offish with total strangers. They should not be territorially aggressive to other domestic dogs but are born with specialized skills and it is common for hounds at play to course another dog. This is a specific hunting behavior, not a fighting or territorial domination behavior. Most Wolfhounds are very gentle with children. The Irish Wolfhound is relatively easy to train. They respond well to firm, but gentle, consistent leadership. However, historically these dogs were required to work at great distances from their masters and think independently when hunting rather than waiting for detailed commands and this can still be seen in the breed.",CAR_4497362e01c0482b9604cdb78316c85709730874,0," '''IRELAND Wolfhounds''':",CAR_45cc1a9aff4b0016eeb52ba1413a1fbecfdaa668,0," Aonghus gor at least a close relativemay have played a part in the Scottish Crown's later campaigning against the Anglo-Irish in Ireland.

Domesticated dogs are clearly distinguishable from wolves by starch gel electrophoresis of red blood cell acid phosphatase. The tympanic bullae are large, convex and almost spherical in gray wolves, while the bullae of dogs are smaller, compressed and slightly crumpled. Compared to equally sized wolves, dogs tend to have 20% smaller skulls and 30% smaller brains. The teeth of gray wolves are also proportionately larger than those of dogs. Compared to wolves, dogs have a more domed forehead. The temporalis muscle that closes the jaws is more robust in wolves. Wolves do not have dewclaws on their back legs, unless there has been admixture with dogs that had them. Dogs lack a functioning pre-caudal gland, and most enter estrus twice yearly, unlike gray wolves which only do so once a year. Dogs require fewer calories to function than wolves. The dog's limp ears may be the result of atrophy of the jaw muscles. The skin of domestic dogs tends to be thicker than that of wolves, with some Inuit tribes favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather. The paws of a dog are half the size of those of a wolf, and their tails tend to curl upwards, another trait not found in wolves The dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal. For example, height measured to the withers ranges from a  in the Chihuahua to  in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called blue) to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark (red or chocolate) in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth.

The Sadlier's New York home became the hub of literary activity in the Catholic community, and Sadlier also enjoyed the company of the brightest Irish writers in the United States and Canada, including New York Archbishop John Hughes, editor Orestes Brownson and Thomas D'Arcy McGee. She held weekly salons in her Manhattan home, as well as her summer home on Far Rockaway on Long Island (James, 219). Her closest friend was D'Arcy McGee, a poet, Irish nationalist exile and Canadian statesman known as one of the founding Fathers of Confederation who helped bring about Canada's independence. McGee and Sadlier shared an interest in a national poetry that would not only capture the spirit of a people, but inspire them to political and national independence. While McGee, as a man, could take part in political rallies and organize Irish-American support for Home Rule, Sadlier, as a woman, directed her support for Irish independence into literature. McGee's associates in Young Ireland included Samuel Ferguson, who in the words of one critic become a link with the Irish Literary Revival of Yeats's generation and were the founders of the Dublin newspaper the Nation (Klinck, 169-170). McGee's biographer notes that Sadlier's success inspired him to write emigrant novels, and was planning a novel on this subject at the time of his death (Phelan, 285). McGee's controversial politics cost him his life, when an Irish-American radical who opposed McGee's shift to the right assassinated him in 1868. McGee, who sorely missed the Sadlier family after their move to New York in 1860, had been planning a visit when he was shot. His death was a crushing blow to Mrs. Sadlier and her husband, who were his enthusiastic friends (Anna Sadlier, 332).
