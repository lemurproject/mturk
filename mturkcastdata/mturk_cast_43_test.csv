Maynard was born in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. He suffered from severe depression and (while still Mayor) committed suicide in 1866 by an overdose of (laudanum) morphine. Long notes of explanation were found in the pockets of his dressing gown, detailing Maynard's struggles with The Evil One (a synonym for Satan). The notes were published verbatim in Ann Arbor's several weekly newspapers. Maynard had been Ann Arbor's biggest land developer, a member and organizer in 1836 of the Ann Arbor Land Company, which acquired the former Henry Rumsey farm east of town, conveying 40 acres thereof to the newly formed State of Michigan as the site of the future University of Michigan, while hoping to profit by subdividing and selling town lots adjacent to the campus. Maynard also developed much of the land west of Ann Arbor's Main Street, as far west as the present Seventh Street. His own landmark dwelling was on the northwest corner of Main and William Street, and the estate stretched west to the present Ashley street, and halfway up the block to Liberty.

Hillar's mother, Karin (Kangas) Rootare, was born in Narva, Estonia, and is of Ingrian-Finnish as well as Estonian descent. Rootare and Carl Prenzlow came up with the Rootare-Prenzlow Equation while in graduate school at the University of Michigan, in typical Estonian fashion over a late-night beer after working in the laboratory, working it out on cocktail napkins at Metzger's bar in Ann Arbor.

People focus on it a bit too much to the point of it possibly becoming a gimmick. People who write about bands need to focus on something, and that is usually the thing. We certainly don't use it as a gimmick; we simply increase the potential of creating new and interesting sounds by introducing new elements (moo, September '96 - issue 25).

Elizabeth is excited but soon finds out she doesn't like Arabella very much and the dislike is mutual, but Elizabeth decides to do her best to hide her dislike, telling herself Be careful, Elizabeth Allen. You're very good at making enemies, but as you found last term, that only makes things difficult for you and your friends. Arabella's a silly, empty-headed doll. You let Whyteleafe deal with her and don't try to cure her all by yourself, Thankfully school restarts soon and Elizabeth won't have to have anything to do with Arabella unless she wants to. As well as Arabella, there are three new students that term; two boys and one girl. Martin seems a pleasant enough chap. Julian is an excellent mimic and very, very clever but he is very untidy, lazy and lackadaisical and Rosemary is a nice girl, but is very timid and weak. Elizabeth soon sees Julian right at the bottom of the form and says Julian, you really ought to try to be top Couldn't be bothered he says Who wants to learn about the tallest mountains? I'm not going to climb them. Who wants to learn history dates? I'll forget them when I grow up, so I couldn't care less. Lessons are pointless and anyway, you're just telling me to work hard because you're a goody-goody monitor. Elizabeth goes to walk off in a huff, but Julian says Oh, c'mon, I'm only teasing. Your friend Joan is in a higher form now, so you won't see much of her for quite a while, so why don't you make friends with me? and Elizabeth does so. At the next meeting, Julian makes a noise like a bubbling saucepan and poor Elizabeth is stuck between a rock and a hard place. She knows she should report him, but he's a new boy and her new best friend. She glares at him and he stops and William says It is not funny to hold up a school meeting and Elizabeth takes the money box round and Arabella does not put all her money in; she keeps a pound to herself and Rosemary gives the game away when she says that peppermint chocolates are such good value. Jenny goes to have a look in Arabella's cubicle and sees the chocolates in her music case Arabella has kept money back and spent it all on chocolates! How mean she tells her form in disgust Well says Harry let's show her what we think of her! I bet at the next meeting she'll put all her money in the box. and everyone gives Arabella the cold shoulder and at the next meeting she says The whole form is making fun of me for no reason that I can see. William asks someone to explain why they're giving Arabella such a hard time and Jenny says Well, William, Arabella kept money back for herself and spent it all on chocolates William consults Elizabeth about it, but she has to say she doesn't really know what Jenny is talking about. Arabella is made to give all her change to Elizabeth and will only have ten pence that week. When the meeting breaks up she says Why didn't someone tell me about Arabella? I felt like a fool! and Jenny explains that she thought Arabella was her friend. One day, Rosemary has to say her money keeps disappearing and no, she hasn't got a hole in her pocket, so Elizabeth marks a coin to see if it disappears and if so, who could have been mean enough to take it and on the next rainy day, the children spin coins and Julian has the marked coin. Elizabeth tackles him over it and Julian denies having stolen it and they split up. Arabella spreads a rumour and Julian plays tricks on Elizabeth to pay her back. In Miss Ranger's class, the books seem to leap off the desk by themselves and Miss Ranger is not pleased Go out of the room, Elizabeth! Once was probably an accident, twice may have been but not three times. You're a monitor and you should know that that sort of behaviour is not acceptable in a class room Elizabeth goes and horror of horrors, here comes Rita I was sent outside, but it was for something that wasn't my fault she explains but Rita says Don't let it happen again. You know that monitors should not do things that get them sent outside. In the French teacher's class, mysterious drops of water fall on Elizabeth's head Ooh she says what is happening? The French teacher thinks Elizabeth is horsing around and says One more sound out of you and you go outside. This is a classroom, not a circus and Elizabeth makes up her mind not to make another sound; she'd rather get saturated than sent outside again. At the end of class, Harry says Elizabeth, how could you behave like that? Let me feel your head. and unfortunately it's as dry as a bone, so Elizabeth doesn't have a leg to stand on. Arabella's birthday comes up and she decides to have a midnight feast and doesn't tell Elizabeth who that night hears a terrific BANG! and when she goes to investigate, she sees Julian with biscuits in his hand Julian she says you're stealing biscuits now! Put them back at once! and in the process makes an awful noise, so the midnight feast has to be cancelled. Julian puts sneezing powder in Elizabeth's French book and she starts sneezing helplessly. She is told to stop and has to say I can't A-TISH-OOOOOO help it and is sent outside again and William comes along, sees her not sneezing there and thinks Elizabeth was just playing a childish prank. She reports Julian for stealing the biscuits, but Arabella explains that they were part of the midnight feast menu and poor Elizabeth realizes that she was wrong about at least the biscuits. William says Elizabeth, you have accused Julian wrongly of stealing and also twice you have been thrown out of the room for playing stupid pranks. That is not the behaviour of a monitor, so you must step down and we will choose someone else in your place. Elizabeth rushes out in tears and Julian begins to feel a bit guilty I know she accused me wrongly of stealing, but she didnt really play the fool in class; her behaviour was really the results of my tricks thinks Julian. Elizabeth is summoned to Williams office and she explains why she thought Julian was a thief. Julian is then summoned and says Oh, I see. A lolly of Elizabeths fell out of my pocket, did it? And there was a marked coin in my pocket? So thats why Elizabeth accused me of stealing, eh? Well, I can now see her point, but I never laid a finger on her lollies or money; someone must have tried to frame me. Anyway, it was not Elizabeths fault she got kicked out of class twice. He turns to Elizabeth and says Elizabeth, I put some springs under your books and that was what made them fly off your desk. I also put some pellets above your head so theyd leak water on you. And I put sneezing powder in your French book. Elizabeth laughs when she remembers what happened, her books flying off the desk in particular and she laughs Youre a real sport says Julian I never thought youd laugh when I told you about the tricks I played on you. Now I like you almost as much as I did before, so will you be my friend again? Oh, yes she says. Elizabeth is a bit mopey and serious for a few days, so Julian plays a trick in the science class and everyone ends up rolling in the aisles with laughter and suddenly everyones friendly again. At the next meeting William says Julian, you should use your brains for work and not just for jokes and tricks. Oh, I couldnt care less about being bottom Julian replies rudely I see says William kindly but I must warn you punishment will come for your laziness and it will, alas be a terrible one Its soon time for the kids end of term outing and Julians mother isnt there yet and Julian reckons the car must have broken down, but he soon finds out the reason for his mothers lateness is far more sinister; shes suddenly very, very ill. Julian races out into the garden and when Elizabeth finds him, he wails My mothers very, very ill; she mightnt live. Why didnt I use my brains for good, worthwhile work instead of only for tricks and jokes? I know my mother couldnt care less about grades, but I wish now Id been top instead of bottom. William was right, punishment was awaiting me and it could not have been a more terrible one. Martin starts to feel very uncomfortable and finally decides to own up that he was the one who was the thief and who framed Julian You horrid thief! she cries You nasty, beastly, rotten, double-faced thief! So it was you who put that coin and those lollies of mine into Julians pocket! Think of all the damage youve done. Because of you I thought that Julian was a thief and I accused him and he played tricks that got me sent outside and I lost my position as a monitor. How could you sleep at night? getting up and walking away. She goes to the music practice room and Rosemary comes in Why were you so beastly to Martin? she asks You know hes so kind and generous and Elizabeth thinks Martin really is a puzzle. How can one person be both kind and unkind; both mean and generous? It just doesnt make sense. The maths class is interrupted by a phone call for none other than Julian and he comes back and says My mums better. MY MUMS BETTER! Miss Ranger lets the class off early; nobody will be able to do any more lessons; theyre too hyper. That night, Elizabeth simply cannot sleep so she goes to have a look at Williams Big Book to see if theres any explanation for Martins strange behaviour and she finds an article about a girl named Tessa who stole things to give to others to win their favour and thats basically what Martin does. Elizabeth confronts Martin and he says I feel simply dreadful, Elizabeth. What can I do to make things better? Well, theres only one thing to do and a coward like you would never do it. You ought to own up at the next school meeting., and lo and behold, just as the meeting is about to break up a voice says Hang on. Ive got something to say and it is Martin William he says I was the one who stole the biscuits, cakes, money and lollies and I planted the marked coin on Julian so everyone would think it was him, not me. I would never have owned up except Julians mother was ill and I hated to think I did that to someone who was so miserable. Also, someone said I was a coward and Im not really Aww thinks Elizabeth look at that. He so badly wanted people to like him and they dont seem to, and now hes had to confess something that will make them dislike him even more. That was a brave thing to do., standing up and saying Well, it wasnt the usual kind of stealing, it wasnt just badness. You see, he stole things to give to people to win their favour. Theres an article in the book about a girl, whose name was Tessa who behaved just like him. Wait a minute and Ill find it., turning to the right page How did you know about Tessa? asks William Well, Martin told me all hed done and I was disgusted she says but all the same, the kids say hes kind and I wondered what made Martin tick, so I looked in the book and found that. Well, Martin says William kindly you cant just buy friends; you have to earn them, so dont steal any more things from your fellows; just be kind, generous and fun to be with and youll soon have more friends than you can count. The meeting finally breaks up and theres only time for an apology from Martin to Julian and a quick dinner. Near the end of the term, Elizabeth gets more than she bargained for on her walk with Julian when some kid falls into the lake. She rescues him and comes back to school dripping wet. She changes her clothes and saunters back to dinner, not wanting any fuss, but at the next school meeting they hear about the heroic deed. It was Elizabeth says Julian it was our Elizabeth Everyone cheers her on and Elizabeth is asked to choose a reward and she says Well, theres a fair on in a nearby town, so could you please let everyone have a few days off to go there? and Miss Best agrees. Julian then stands up and says And please make Elizabeth a monitor again; she deserves it., and his request is also granted",CAR_4d3c60d0abbe206aa001e7d6f4e8dfe076ea17fd,0," He was also mayor of Ann Arbor 1888-1890, postmaster of Ann Arbor 1894-1898, city treasurer 1891-1893 and 19031905, and city assessor 1906-1913.

You're into the spiritual domain when you ask ultimate questions'what's the ultimate meaning of life?', when you deal with totalities'What is the entire world like? What is my whole life like? How should I live my whole life?' And 'boundary conditions' is a little harder to explain, but think in terms of, When have I reached the limit? For example, if I tell you that I know something, you may ask me how I know and I may be able to give you an answer. Then when I give you the answer, that has to be something else that I know, and so you may ask me about it, and I may give you an answer. But ultimately, we reach some kind of end because I can't give you answers forever. All knowledge has that structure, that you can back up some knowledge with other knowledge, and you can back that up with some other, but there is never an infinite sequence of backing up. You do reach an end point. The fact that you reach an end point is an example of a boundary condition with respect to knowledge, that knowledge is not founded on an infinite set of foundations, nor is it founded on a secure foundation.  A secure foundation is just some other fact that one can ask questions about. So knowledge starts somewhere, and it doesn't start from further knowledge, ultimately. And it's in dealing with such questions as, 'Where does our knowledge come from?  What is its foundations?  What kind of confidence can we have in it?'  these kinds of questions, I think are what you're dealing with when you think of a religion.",CAR_69f4dc6a4acd64ec7316ff99291ebaa6277e4266,0," On August 26, 1896, the two companies formally merged to become the Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti Electric Railway (AA&YRy).

Abbot president, much to the professor's surprise. Nevertheless, the soft-spoken Abbot remained president for twenty-two years and helped stabilize the College during and after the Civil War. One of the College's main concerns was that its Morrill Act endowment had attracted the University of Michigan's attention.  Advocates for the University brought a bill before the State Legislature to merge with the Agricultural College and move the Lansing faculty and facilities to the Ann Arbor campus. UM leaders argued that it was necessary to share the Morrill Act income with the financially struggling UM. At least one influential pro-merger advocate appeared persuaded more by pure academic considerations than financial self-interest.  Andrew Dickson White, Cornell University co-founder and first president, noted, The State of Michigan . . . indeed gave its Agricultural College an excellent faculty and they have achieved much success considering their means but infinitely better would it have been to combine that Agricultural College with their noble University.   While the plan initially had broad support across the state, merger opponents pointed out that Ann Arbor had inadequate facilities for an agricultural education; a move to Ann Arbor would require so much investment capital as to make the UM plan financially untenable. The Legislature voted down UM's proposal in 1863, but it returned to the floor in 1865, 1867, and again in 1869. While the College successfully fended off each takeover attempt, the persistent threat that it might move kept the Legislature from appropriating any money for new campus construction at Lansing.

In The Idea of Community in the Study of Writing, Joseph Harris echoes Bruffees sentiments that the community and individual work at cross-purposes within the university setting. He claims that although the term collaborative usually connotes a positive sense of belonging, community in reality often creates an us versus them mentality, and also creating a dichotomy between individual and group, or in this case, student versus university. He wonders, If to enter the academic community a student must learn to speak our language in reference to David Bartholomaes Inventing the University, and become accustomed and reconciled to our ways of doing things with words, then how exactly is she to do this?.

He also worked within the Government to facilitate housing in Canberra for officials moving from other cities, and was involved in establishing cultural organisations in the city. In 1928 he was the inaugural President of the Canberra Rotary Club. In 1929, he formed the Canberra University Association in order to promote the formation of a university in Canberra, and in 1930 organised the establishment of Canberra University College (essentially a campus of the University of Melbourne) which taught undergraduate courses, chairing its council for its first twenty-three years. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Garran consistently advocated the establishment of what he prophetically called 'a National University at Canberra' , which would be primarily for specialist research and postgraduate study, in areas particularly relating to Australia, such as foreign relations with Asia and the Pacific region. This vision was evidently influential on the establishment of the Australian National University (ANU) in 1946, the only research-only university in the country (although in 1960 it amalgamated with Canberra University College to offer undergraduate courses).",CAR_2e13e7b0f4e7aa2298955ed518fc3c039d56059c,0," The first informal classrooms in Ann Arbor Public Schools were established in 1971, followed by Community High School in 1972 and a centralized Middle Years Alternative program in 1976.

The core-periphery model basically features an amount of economic activity in one main area surrounded by a remote area of less dense activity. The concentration of this economic activity in one area (usually a city center) allows for the growth and expansion of activity into other and surrounding areas because of the cost-minimizing location decisions of firms within these agglomeration economies sustaining high productivity and advantages which therefore allow them to grow outside of the city (core) and into the periphery. A small decrease in the fixed cost of production can increase the range of locations for further establishment of firms leading to loss of concentration in the city and possibly the development of a new city outside the original city where agglomeration and increasing returns to scale existed.",CAR_75fb7dbd2b9446d526a4c8060bd0c2737955e7a0,0," In Ancient Greece, colonies were sometimes founded by vanquished people, who left their homes to escape subjection at the hand of a foreign enemy; sometimes as a sequel to civil disorders, when the losers in internecine battles left to form a new city elsewhere; sometimes to get rid of surplus population, and thereby to avoid internal convulsions; and sometimes as a result of ostracism.

Abbot president, much to the professor's surprise. Nevertheless, the soft-spoken Abbot remained president for twenty-two years and helped stabilize the College during and after the Civil War. One of the College's main concerns was that its Morrill Act endowment had attracted the University of Michigan's attention.  Advocates for the University brought a bill before the State Legislature to merge with the Agricultural College and move the Lansing faculty and facilities to the Ann Arbor campus. UM leaders argued that it was necessary to share the Morrill Act income with the financially struggling UM. At least one influential pro-merger advocate appeared persuaded more by pure academic considerations than financial self-interest.  Andrew Dickson White, Cornell University co-founder and first president, noted, The State of Michigan . . . indeed gave its Agricultural College an excellent faculty and they have achieved much success considering their means but infinitely better would it have been to combine that Agricultural College with their noble University.   While the plan initially had broad support across the state, merger opponents pointed out that Ann Arbor had inadequate facilities for an agricultural education; a move to Ann Arbor would require so much investment capital as to make the UM plan financially untenable. The Legislature voted down UM's proposal in 1863, but it returned to the floor in 1865, 1867, and again in 1869. While the College successfully fended off each takeover attempt, the persistent threat that it might move kept the Legislature from appropriating any money for new campus construction at Lansing.

He lent financial and other support to artists, including Kokoschka and Jacques Lipchitz, whose studio was destroyed by fire in 1952.   Later he allowed his collection to be exhibited as a fundraiser for an organization helping immigrant populations settle in New York.The Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation was established in 1955 as a not-for-profit organization and is the current owner of the collection. The first exhibition of the collection took place in 1958: twenty-seven selected works, lent anonymously, to the Baltimore Museum of Art.  Numerous exhibitions of the collection (in whole and in part) have taken place over the past six decades, including the following: forty-six works were shown at Knoedler & Company in New York in 1959; the Fogg Museum in 1959; the collection was featured in different exhibitions at the Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1960, 1964, 1974 and 1986; the Detroit Institute of Art in 1967; the Wadsworth Atheneum in 1970; the National Gallery of Art in 1972, and at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco in 1982. A 1960 article in Connoisseur magazine describes Pearlmans unflagging fascination of the hunt  He trusts a stubborn faith in his own taste and has no interest in assembling an anthology of the standard names of modern art, but only those artists who have a special appeal to his individual taste.In 1961 Pearlman began making summer loans to museums, starting with the Metropolitan Museum of Arts Paintings from Private Collections: Summer Loan Exhibition series, in part so that the works would be safe and seen while he and Rose were in Croton. (When not on loan, the collection was divided between their Park Avenue apartment and Henrys office in midtown Manhattan.)",CAR_daf20a16c5e4776b11a38076c854ab3ca2d06a37,0," American Federation of Arts, New York, New York; The Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois; Boise Art Museum, Boise, Idaho;Cantor Art Center, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California; Cedar Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California; De Young (Anderson Gallery of Graphic Arts), San Francisco, California; Donald Bren Foundation, Los Angeles, California; Flint Institute of Arts, Flint, Michigan; Fondation Carmignac, Paris, France; Frederick R.

There are two lakes created by dams, which were once fish ponds. To the north of the second lake is Fountain Dale moat, which is known to have existed in 1251, when there was a hunting lodge on the  island, from which tolls were collected by the forester Raffe Clerc. There is a  wide causeway across the north-eastern corner of the moat, which is around  wide, with a substantial bank beyond that. The site has not been disturbed since it was abandoned, and so is better preserved than many residential moated sites in Britain. To the south of the lake is the Grade II listed Fountain Dale House, dating from the mid-eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. At the outlet of the lake is a Grade II listed well head constructed of ashlar and red brick, called Friar Tuck's well, after which the river turns to the north-east to reach another artificial lake called Cave Pond. Passing under Blidworth Lane on the outskirts of Rainworth, it enters an 'L'-shaped lake, called L Lake, the other branch of which is fed by Foulevil Brook.

In 1986 a group of villagers began a project to restore and maintain it as a nature conservation area and village amenity. The village pond is still going strong today under the guardianship of The Friends of the Biddenham Village Pond, a voluntary organisation.

Lonand, 2.9 m.) lies in the north-west corner of the Phaltan Taluka, about 12 miles south-west of Phaltan, the taluka headquarters! The fort is now easily approachable throughout the year as the Public Works Department has recently constructed a pucca road from village Tathavade lying at the foot of the hill. The fort is roughly triangular in shape. The hill on which it stands is a little lower than the main range. The apices of the triangle are north-west and south-east making it nearly equilateral. At the foot on the northern side lies the village of Tathavade (p. 1,001) with people nearly all cultivators mostly Ramoshis and Marathas. The defences consist of three walls, the top wall going all round the hill and forming what may be called the citadel. It surmounts a perpendicular scarp of black rock about thirty feet high, and is itself about fifteen feet higher. In thickness it is twenty feet and had originally a parapet about six feet high and three feet thick, all of which has broken down. It is made of laterite blocks from one or two cubic feet each, and solidly set in mortar, lined with small stones and mud. It is carefully provided at intervals with secret escape doors for the garrison should the fort be successfully taken. It is especially strong at the three angles from which project triangular outworks about sixty feet lower than the citadel. The outworks are of unequal size, but built of the same materials and more strongly even than the citadel. The sides of the south-west out-work are not more than thirty yards long but it is perhaps the most solid of the three; the sides of the north-east outwork are about fifty yards, and those of the north-west out-work about seventy yards long. The first two out-works communicated with the citadel by a small door not more than two feet wide built through the walls, which led on to the steps cut in the scarp. The citadel wall has a gap at the north-west angle which formed the communication with the north-west out-work. On the north-east side of this was the main gateway about five feet wide, also made of laterite, of beautifully cut massive masonry. It faced, and was sheltered by a projecting bastion. The north side of the hill was partly protected for about a hundred feet by two lower walls or terraces, the one below the other with bastions at intervals. They are of much lighter workmanship than the blocks in rough mortar and the lining of uncut stones and mud. These walls both run east and west along the entire length of the northern face of the hill. They then turn through an angle of over 90 degrees, and are taken up the hill to meet the walls above them. The upper of the two is broken by a gateway of trap facing east, like the upper gateway, similarly sheltered, and otherwise like it, but of far less strength and of much rougher workmanship. The lowest wall is divided by a gap of full thirty feet in the centre flanked by two strong bastions, but no gateway. The ascent between these three entrances and from the north-west out-work on to the citadel is by a winding path with steps at intervals where, not unfrequently, the naked scarp of the rock has to be surmounted. The steps are nearly everywhere broken down and the way generally blocked with prickly pear. The above description will show that the hill was unprotected below the citadel and its out-works on the south-west and south-east sides, and that elaborate care was taken to protect the north side. There seems to be no special reason for this difference except that the entrance and therefore the weakest point of the citadel was on the north side. By making the two gateways face east and protecting them with projections of the wall, their assault was impeded while it was impossible to hit them directly with cannon shot from the plain below, which, according to tradition, was a special point in the fortification of the day. In sieges it was apparently the fashion to direct a cannonade first against the gate and to provide a force to rush through if the besiegers succeeded in bursting it. The difficulties of elsewhere penetrating or escalading hill forts such as these, were probably and not wrongly thought insuperable, bribery and stratagem apart. The citadel is not more than 600 yards round and its area not much more than twenty acres. There were originally but few buildings. The head-quarters or sadar was a building about fifty feet by thirty feet including its two otas or verandahs. It opened to the north and besides accommodating the treasury, was used as a sort of court-house for the subhedar in charge of the fort. Next to it on the west was a stone building about forty feet by twenty, with walls three feet thick, and a roof on the south side made of brick coated with cement. It contained three chambers for storage of grain, treasure and gunpowder. The east chamber still remains. Immediately south of the east chamber is the great pond, cut some sixty to seventy feet down into the rock, and the sides smoothed off with great care. It holds a tolerable supply of water, but is fed by no spring. It is about twenty-five to thirty feet square and has steps on the eastern side leading down to the water's edge. Halfway down at a landing and turn of the steps is a small temple of Tatoba Mahadev from whom the fort takes its name. This large pond was apparently the only source of the water-supply of the citadel. It has been much choked with silt, and is said to hold much less water than before, much probably leaking down through the laterite. The rest of the citadel is so blocked with prickly pear that no other buildings can be distinguished. The hill top has room only for very few. One is a mosque for Musalmans. The north-east out-work has some buildings while, inside the two lower walls, are others all in ruins. Outside the lowest entrance is pointed out the side of the elephant-house, fit for not more than two beasts. On the saddle back between the southern angle and the main range of hills has been cut a gap with remains of buildings said to have been the grass stacks of the fort. The grass was supplied chiefly from lands on the plateau above the Mahadev range and brought for storage to this spot. It is more than two hundred yards from the fort and is hardly convenient than the village itself which is at least as accessible as the fort. Immediately inside and directely facing the lowest entrance is a large cave pond. Its mouth has been almost wholly blocked with rubbish. A descent of some six feet is therefore necessary to reach the water. The excavation is partly natural but evidently enlarged artificially. The exact size of the cave pond cannot be made out. Three massive pillars appear supporting the roof. The rock is laterite and hence no doubt the abundant supply of excellent water filters from above. The upper fort is nearly all made of laterite with no traces of quarrying about. It seems therefore not improbable that the ponds were excavated by the fort builders and the stone used for the fort walls. There are four other similar ponds completely blocked up. Their stone and that of the big pond on the top would amply suffice for the external work considerable as it is. The mildew of this laterite is used by the people as a tonic for women after child-birth. It probably contains some principle of iron. It is a belief in the village that the large pond in the citadel and this cave pond are connected by a passage now choked up, and that a lemon thrown into the water of the one used in former times to appear on the surface of the other. These ponds show that the hill internally is made of laterite with an outer coating of trap, thin at the sides but on the top some forty feet thick.",CAR_400b10bcf4b595aee345bada28c63b756505a06c,0," The Kerrytown Shops, Main Street Business District, the State Street Business District, and the South University Business District are commercial areas in downtown Ann Arbor.

In jazz, chords are often arranged vertically in major or minor thirds, although stacked fourths are also quite common. Also, jazz music tends to favor certain harmonic progressions and includes the addition of tensions, intervals such as 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths to chords. Additionally, scales unique to style are used as the basis of many harmonic elements found in jazz.

As jazz spread around the world, it drew on different national, regional, and local musical cultures, giving rise to many distinctive styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. In the 1930s, swing big bands, Kansas City jazz, and Gypsy jazz were the prominent styles. Bebop and cool jazz emerged in the 1940s, and the 1950s saw free jazz, hard bop, and modal jazz. Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock rhythms, electronic instruments and the highly amplified stage sound of rock, with large festivals exhibiting the sounds in response.

While there had always been a close association between free jazz and political and social strife in Europe, many supporters of the genre began pushing to depoliticize the music, urging listeners to consider free jazz as an art form rather than simply a provocative statement on society bereft of any actual musicality. Many listeners of the time believed that, free jazz was as much a political as a musical phenomenon. During this time, there were fears that if free jazz was only considered as a mechanism for political commentary, that it would lose its validity as an art form, or at worst, be subject to censorship by European governments. Due to this possibility, there was a surge amongst the free jazz community to dissociate the word free with the political environment it is so commonly associated with. In addition to the depoliticizing of this genre of music, other critics asserted that,Were jazz to be valued henceforth according to its capacity to reveal something of the social conditions under which it was produced or the political beliefs that its producers espoused, then its relevance for those outside the particular community from which it issues would be limited. In other words, by only associating jazz or free jazz with a particular ideology or thought process, in effect only those of a similar thought process can understand or appreciate it fully. Rather, if the free jazz genre was dissociated from the view that it is simply a vehicle for political commentary, and instead it was viewed objectively as a form of art, it would not only would be accessible to a larger audience, but it would allow itself to be judged as an art rather than the political statement it may or may not be attempting to make.",CAR_648ccc6e5c711271f07a3b7e4e4e382b02debfb8,0," Ann Arbor Charter Township is a charter township of Washtenaw County in the U.S. state of Michigan.

Since the 1920s during the jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression following George Gershwin and other notable composers. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music.

However, in a 2007 interview, Bland described the film's reception in the following manner: It was considered the work of madmen. Black racists. At best it was considered a personal statement. Bad music, bad thinking, bad acting, bad writing and bad photography. Unfair to jazz, because we made jazz a political act. However, The Cry of Jazz did receive some favorable coverage from white film critics.

Each of these albums made a unique contribution to jazz.  With Kind of Blue, Miles Davis established a previously developing style of jazz, called modal jazz, which uses fewer chords and melodic improvisation based on scales. Today Kind of Blue is recognized as the best-selling jazz album of all time. In Time Out, Dave Brubeck and his quartet pushed the boundaries of jazz by experimenting with different time signatures, such as 98 in Blue Rondo a la Turk and 54 in Take Five. Up to this point, the vast majority of jazz was based on 44 time. Time Out also became extremely popular for a jazz album, and catapulted Brubeck to international fame. Charles Minguss Mingus Ah Um is most notable for its variety. Mingus was adept at pulling inspiration from and composing in a multiplicity of jazz styles. Elements of swing, hard bop, soul jazz, and cool jazz, are all evident in Mingus Ah Um. With The Shape of Jazz to Come, Ornette Coleman took jazz in a radical new direction by debuting avant-garde jazz. This new style did away with many of the characteristic features of jazz, including easily discernable rhythms, regular form, and planned harmonic structure. For instance, the track Lonely Woman is not based on an underlying chord progression. While The Shape of Jazz to Come was very controversial, it did expand the boundaries of jazz.",CAR_d144cfe9d2cf9743fcbf4dc5d82dbed681091351,0," University of Galway, Ireland;Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Lisbon;Boymans-van Beuningen Museum, Rotterdam;Peter Stuyvesant Foundation, Amsterdam;Art Gallery of Western Australia, Perth;Power Gallery of Contemporary Art, Sydney University;Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane;Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide;Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney;Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto;London Art Gallery, Ontario;Montreal Museum of Fine Arts;Muse d'Art Contemporain de Montreal;Vancouver Art Gallery;Setagaya Art Museum, Tokyo;Ohnishi Museum, Kogawa Prefecture;Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York;Albuquerque Museum, New Mexico:Brooklyn Museum, New York;Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania;The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York;Mint Museum of Art, Charlotte, North Carolina;Museum of Art, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;Smith College Museum of Art, Northampton, Massachusetts;Art Museum, University of Texas at Austin;Toledo Museum of Art, Ohio;Frederick R Weisman Foundation, Los Angeles;Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut.and others not listed",CAR_d14a3615eaccd0ee8056833568fac141a64b81d6,0," Festival appearances are also a significant part of his performance schedule.

While in the United States modern jazz and electric R&B may have represented opposite poles of blues-based Afro-American music, the British pop music of the beat boom developed out of the skiffle and R&B championed by well-known jazzmen such as Chris Barber. English fusion guitarist John McLaughlin, for example, had played what Allmusic describes as a blend of jazz and American R&B with Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames as early as 1962 and continued with The Graham Bond Organisation (with Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker) whose style Allmusic calls rhythm & blues with a strong jazzy flavor. Bond himself had begun playing straight jazz with Don Rendell, while Manfred Mann, who recorded a Cannonball Adderley tune on their first album, when joined by Bruce turned out the 1966 EP record Instrumental Asylum, which undoubtedly fused jazz and rock.

Goffin played music with some classmates of the Brussels law school in the local bars and dance halls. During that time jazz was also synonymous with dance music. According to Faecq it was only when she saw the original black bands that he and his friend Goffin realized that jazz was more than just dance music. Together they discovered jazz music thrrough listening to the Mitchell's Jazz Kings and other black bands in the Alhambra theater. In that period Belgium was in fact the 'jazz capital' of Europe. There were also successful white jazz bands, such as The Georgians with Charles Remue - now considered a pioneer of jazz in Belgium. From 1920 on he led his The Bing Boys.

They began in Hamburg. These groups are motivated by the desire to have a good time and have increasingly assumed a character bordering on the criminal-antisocial. Even before the war boys and girls from Hamburg from the socially privileged classes joined groups, wearing strikingly casual clothing and became fans of English music i.e. American music and dance. At the turn of the year 19391940 the Flottbeck group organized dances which were attended by 5-6000 young people and which were marked by an uninhibited indulgence in swing. After the ban on public dances they organized dances at home, which were marked above all by sexual promiscuity...The hunger for English dance music and for their own dance bands led to break-ins in shops selling musical instruments. The greed to participate in what appeared to them to be a stylish life in clubs, bars, cafes and house balls suppressed any positive attitude towards responding to the needs of the time.

It includes jazz clubs, clubs, dancehalls and historic venues such as theatres. A jazz club is a venue where the primary entertainment is the performance of live jazz music. Jazz clubs are usually a type of nightclub or bar, which is licensed to sell alcoholic beverages. Jazz clubs were in large rooms in the eras of Orchestral jazz and big band jazz, when bands were large and often augmented by a string section.
