These GC analyse hydrocarbons (C2-C40+). In a typical experiment, a packed column is used to separate the light gases, which are then detected with a TCD.  The hydrocarbons are separated using a capillary column and detected with a FID.  A complication with light gas analyses that include H is that He, which is the most common and most sensitive inert carrier (sensitivity is proportional to molecular mass) has an almost identical thermal conductivity to hydrogen (it is the difference in thermal conductivity between two separate filaments in a Wheatstone Bridge type arrangement that shows when a component has been eluted).  For this reason, dual TCD instruments used with a separate channel for hydrogen that uses nitrogen as a carrier are common.  Argon is often used when analysing gas phase chemistry reactions such as F-T synthesis so that a single carrier gas can be used rather than two separate ones.

Type II prodrugs are bioactivated extracelluarly, either in the milieu of GI fluids (Type IIA), within the systemic circulation andor other extracellular fluid compartments (Type IIB), or near therapeutic target tissuescells (Type IIC), relying on common enzymes such as esterases and phosphatases or target directed enzymes. Importantly, prodrugs can belong to multiple subtypes (i.e., Mixed-Type). A Mixed-Type prodrug is one that is bioactivated at multiple sites, either in parallel or sequential steps. For example, a prodrug, which is bioactivated concurrently in both target cells and metabolic tissues, could be designated as a Type IAIB prodrug (e.g., HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors and some chemotherapy agents; note the symbol    applied here). When a prodrug is bioactivated sequentially, for example initially in GI fluids then systemically within the target cells, it is designated as a Type IIA-IA prodrug (e.g., tenofovir disoproxil; note the symbol  -  applied here).

While working on the series The Stations of the Spectrum (1967-1969), Baer painted over their white surfaces to make them gray. She then turned them into triptychs because she saw that these paintings had more wall power when they were hung together. Next, as she said, I wanted to know what happens around a corner  that interested me as an optical thing. The result was the Wraparound paintings, where-in which Baer painted thick black bands edged by blues, greens, oranges, and lavenders that went around the sides of the canvas  areas that artists customarily ignore, overlook, or cover with a frame.

Today there are dozens of books that have been published about specific areas using the now established term, famous first... Famous Firsts are often heralded as news stories and may be documented with patents and even with celebrations. Firsts have been recorded for a long time and are a widely documented area of study, most particularly in the core library reference work Famous First Facts by Joseph Nathan Kane, first published by H. W. Wilson Company in 1933. Kane was the first to provide a comprehensive collation of famous firsts. To this day, with each subsequent edition released (now in its 5th edition), Kane's remains H.W. Wilson's largest-selling single volume reference work. Many of Kane's entries are actually rather obscure, so the term famous first can be misleading; they are more accurately termed notable; hence the term notable last was chosen for the study of lasts, rather than famous lasts. The term famous last could have not only a similarly misleading connotation, but also be potentially confused with the cautionary words of advice, famous last words, often uttered sarcastically when an undertaking or prediction is made. Recognition of firsts has received more attention given the importance our society places on innovation, ingenuity and discovery. Thus, firsts are easier to research and authenticate. A last, on the other hand, frequently is difficult to track down, as there is not an analogous historical record. A few small trivia books have compiled a limited number of lasts (particularly two small British works by Christopher Slee and a generalized work by trivia compiler Charles Panati). These are works that include general lasts, not only notable lasts as defined in the first substantial work on notable lasts called Notable Last Facts published by Reference Desk Press, Inc. by William B. Brahms in 2005. Brahms' work was recognized by the American Library Association publication Booklist as 2005's best addition to the trivia shelf.",CAR_a72f782721d26219772c4e3798eb4a9f554326f1,0,,

This is natures evolutionary solution to animals need to inhibit arousals, such as anger, urge to eat or urge to mate, whenever such instincts are inappropriate or dangerous to act on at the time; the arousals are safely deactivated later in dreams. In civilised societies, of course, people are commonly in circumstances where strong feelings are aroused but it is inappropriate to act on them. Arguments do not feature in dreams, as the emotion is expressed; private worries, fears, urges not given into (such as for a forbidden food or activity) do. Griffin has theorised that by enabling arousals to be safely discharged in dreams, once they have been activated, REM sleep serves to keep our instincts and drives intact. (If continually activated but not acted upon in any form, they would gradually become extinct.)

In 1944, her 15-year-old daughter was killed by a hit-and-run driver while bicycling. She took to hiking in the desert with a friend, Harry Aleson. They found in one another what author David Lavender calls a mutual sedation for the lonely, restless questing that was eating out their insides. Harry had recently fallen in love with the lower Colorado River through Grand Canyon, and invited White on a different sort of adventure, to demonstrate  that in the event of a boating accident, it would be easier to float downstream than hike out. So in late June 1945, they made their way up river from Diamond Creek at mile 226, and plunged in the current, running at , and swam  down to Lake Mead. Though wearing the bulky Mae West life jacket, they were still able to carry backpacks for watertight tins that contained first-aid supplies, food, cameras and film. They arrived exhausted three days later at Lake Mead.  The eccentric pair wanted to prove beyond a doubt that river travel was a safe proposition, and provide good press for the emerging commercial rafting industry. So in June 1946, Aleson and White hiked down Parashant Wash, arriving at the Colorado River at mile 198. After recovering from their epic hike, where they nearly perished from thirst, they built a raft fashioned after James White's, who had allegedly been the first to float the Grand Canyon in 1867. But they were unable to launch it into the raging torrent, running the same volume as the previous year. They opted instead to use a one-man U.S. Army Air Corp rescue raft that they had packed in. So on June 26, they began an epic journey down to Lake Mead, unimaginable by modern river runners.",CAR_b7c34da36abeae65d1260337a3163463e61deb88,0,,

Heather, 12 Pack, and The Entertainer praise  for getting rid of Chance and invite her and Toastee into their Gold Team Alliance. Whiteboy and Megan flirt outside, and begin to form crushes on each other. They decide that they will have each other's backs. Whiteboy, Real, and Hoopz realize they are no longer the majority alliance in the house and decide it's time for the Green Team to step up. The house is now split into three alliances, The Gold Team Alliance, The Stallionare Alliance, and the Secret Alliance which nobody knows about. In the Gold Team Alliance is 12 Pack, Heather, The Entertainer, , and Toastee. The Stallionare Alliance is Whiteboy, Real, Rodeo, and Hoopz. The Secret Alliance ironically contains Megan, Brandi C., , and Toastee because Megan and Brandi C., who are now very close best friends, don't like  and Toastee and vice versa. Rodeo is trying to be on good terms with the Gold Team Alliance but sways towards the Stallionare Alliance. In this week's challenge, the Gold Team chooses Heather to be captain, since she has never been one. Megan tries to persuade the Green Team to allow her to be captain as planned. Whiteboy and Real are skeptical, but Megan convinces them. They make her swear on The Bible that she will eliminate who they want, and Megan agrees. Megan later says I do what I want to do. The teams hit the streets of Mexico to compete in a worldly challenge of cuisine, based on places the of Love contestants visited on their shows. The stops are Los Angeles, Las Vegas, France, and Jamaica. Three members of the Gold team must sit out, since there are only four members of the Green team left. Heather chooses Hoopz,  and herself to sit out. In this challenge, two members of one team must pull a miniature tour bus, with two other members on board, hitting all of the stops. The teams must eat all of the food at each stop before proceeding onto the next one. The first team to consume all of the food and reach the finish line wins. On the Gold Team, 12 Pack and The Entertainer pull, while Toastee and Rodeo ride. On the Green Team, Real and Whiteboy pull, while Brandi C. and Megan ride. Before the challenge began, Rodeo and Hoopz had a plan to throw the challenge, but since Hoopz must sit out, Rodeo must do it on her own. The Green team moves rather quickly during the challenge, while Rodeo takes her time eating, and even The Entertainer has a hard time eating some of the food. In the end, the Green team wins the challenge by a long shot. Hoopz congratulates the Green Team for winning and Heather yells at Hoopz for her betrayal and The Entertainer sticks up for Heather and screams at Hoopz. Hoopz is about to hit him, until Real physically removes her away from The Entertainer. Megan becomes Paymaster, and in the vault, the Gold Team chooses Rodeo and Hoopz to go into the strongbox for their betrayal of the Gold Team, and Toastee voluntary puts herself in, figuring she's safe because of her new Secret Alliance with Megan. On the power outing, they take a boat down the river. Megan takes the opportunity to mess with Rodeo, because she knows Rodeo will do whatever she tells her to do. She wants to make Rodeo feel guilty because earlier, Rodeo plotted against Megan and trash-talked her. She makes Rodeo try to ride some wild horses they saw while they were rafting down the river, and when Rodeo fails to do so, Megan sarcastically says that now she'll never keep Rodeo, and Rodeo freaks out. When they arrive at lunch, Megan tells the girls that she will not be making the decisions, her dog, Lily, would. So instead of convincing her why they should stay, Megan makes the three talk to Lily instead. Both Hoopz and Toastee pretend to talk to Lily, but Rodeo emotionally tells Lily if they keep her, she'd do whatever to keep Megan in the game, and says that if she wins she will share the money with Megan. Rodeo repeatedly apologizes to Megan. Megan, wanting to embarrass Rodeo, asks her For what? every time Rodeo says she's sorry, knowing that Rodeo does not want to admit she was talking about her. Megan then says she's putting them through the final test. She asks each contestant why they should not be sent home. Hoopz says she's the most loyal in the house. Megan responds by saying, So your saying I should keep you because you're loyal to other people? Hoopz tells Megan that she can be loyal to her if they come to that agreement. Megan then interviews Hoopz has been loyal to Whiteboy, and Real, and Chance this whole time. It doesn't have anything to do with me though. I believe she's loyal to them, but there's no like connection. (laughs) So why the f**k do I care? (laughs) Megan chooses to spend the one-on-one time with Rodeo. Rodeo tries to win her over, still apologizing and even hugging her, but nothing works: It's only a chance for Megan to make Rodeo feel bad for all of the things she has said behind Megan's back. Megan tells Rodeo that she thinks her apologies are fake because if Rodeo's team would've won the challenge today, Rodeo would not apologize for the things she said. Rodeo stumbles over what Megan said and then interview that she needs the money the most because she only has $100 left.  and Brandi C. try to convince Megan to get rid of Hoopz, saying that if they do not eliminate her now, she'll go to the finale. Megan, however, wants to be on good terms with Whiteboy, and thinks that eliminating Hoopz will only get her eliminated. She figures that eliminating Rodeo would be the smartest thing to do for herself, because Rodeo had no true alliance so no one would want her gone for eliminating her. At elimination, Megan gives Toastee her check first, insulting her before and afterwards, only because she does not want anyone to know about the Secret Alliance. Ultimately, Megan gives Hoopz her check because she does not want to cause turmoil between Whiteboy and his alliance. Megan tells Rodeo that she used to be scared of her, but that she is not scared of her anymore and voids her check. Hoopz gets her check and stands next to the Green team, stating that that was her true team.

Nutrients are primarily lost by leaching into cooking water, which tends to make microwave cooking healthier, given the shorter cooking times it requires.  Like other heating methods, microwaving converts vitamin B from an active to inactive form; the amount of inactivation depends on the temperature reached, as well as the cooking time. Boiled food reaches a maximum of  (the boiling point of water), whereas microwaved food can get locally hotter than this, leading to faster breakdown of vitamin B.

He finds a hollow tree and decides to make it his home.  Remembering how Native Americans used fire to create dugout canoes, he uses fire to make the interior of the hollow tree bigger. One day, while Sam is chopping an ash tree to make a bed, an old woman named Mrs. Thomas Fiedler forces him to help her pick strawberries.  Seeing a peregrine falcon hunting for its prey, Sam decides he wants a falcon as a hunting bird.  Sam returns to town to get a haircut, and reads up on falconry at the local public library.  He camps near a cliff for several days to learn the location of a peregrine falcon nest, and steals a chick from the nest while the mother bird attacks him.

When a poacher illegally kills a deer, Sam hides the carcass from the hunter so he can use it for food, a door, and a new pair of clothes.

During the 8196 AD reign of Domitian, the tradition of serving a lettuce salad before a meal began. Post-Roman Europe continued the tradition of poaching lettuce, mainly with large romaine types, as well as the method of pouring a hot oil and vinegar mixture over the leaves.

He finds a hollow tree and decides to make it his home.  Remembering how Native Americans used fire to create dugout canoes, he uses fire to make the interior of the hollow tree bigger. One day, while Sam is chopping an ash tree to make a bed, an old woman named Mrs. Thomas Fiedler forces him to help her pick strawberries.  Seeing a peregrine falcon hunting for its prey, Sam decides he wants a falcon as a hunting bird.  Sam returns to town to get a haircut, and reads up on falconry at the local public library.  He camps near a cliff for several days to learn the location of a peregrine falcon nest, and steals a chick from the nest while the mother bird attacks him.  He names the bird Frightful, because of the difficult time he had getting the nestling.  A short time later, Sam is forced to hide in the woods for two days.  A forest ranger, spotting the smoke from Sam's cooking fire, came to investigate what he believed was a forest fire. The ranger lingers near Sam's home overnight, but leaves after believing that whoever started the fire must have left the place. Sam also relates to the reader his memories about his adventures in the fall.  He makes a box trap to catch animals to eat, but ends up catching a weasel instead.  Sam calls the weasel The Baron for the fearless way the animal moves about the hollowed-out treehouse.  Realizing winter is coming, Sam wants to kill a deer so he can make a door for his home. He learns how to smoke meat to preserve it for winter, and how to tan hides.  When a poacher illegally kills a deer, Sam hides the carcass from the hunter so he can use it for food, a door, and a new pair of clothes. Sam remembers how he tanned the hide using a hollow tree stump and various plants.  He also avoids townspeople who wander near his home by hiding in the woods.  Sam trains Frightful to hunt, and the bird proves very good at it.  Sam prepares for winter by hunting frogs, pheasants, rabbits, and sparrows; preserving wild grains and tubers; smoking fish and meat; and preparing storage spaces by hollowing out the trunks of trees. Finding another poached deer, Sam makes himself deerskin clothing to replace his worn-out city clothes. Sam notices a raccoon digging for mussels in the creek, and he learns how to hunt for shellfish.

In this sense, the master morality is the full recognition that oneself is the measure of all moral truths.

The steam treatment causes the air to expand and about 25% of the air to be expelled from the chips. The next step is to saturate the chips with black and white liquor. Air remaining in chips at the beginning of liquor impregnation is trapped within the chips. The impregnation can be done before or after the chips enters the digester and is normally done below . The cooking liquors consist of a mixture of white liquor, water in chips, condensed steam and weak black liquor.

Something is good in itself when it is intrinsically good, and good without qualification, when the addition of that thing never makes a situation ethically worse. Kant then argues that those things that are usually thought to be good, such as intelligence, perseverance and pleasure, fail to be either intrinsically good or good without qualification. Pleasure, for example, appears not to be good without qualification, because when people take pleasure in watching someone suffer, this seems to make the situation ethically worse. He concludes that there is only one thing that is truly good:Kant then argues that the consequences of an act of willing cannot be used to determine that the person has a good will; good consequences could arise by accident from an action that was motivated by a desire to cause harm to an innocent person, and bad consequences could arise from an action that was well-motivated. Instead, he claims, a person has a good will when he 'acts out of respect for the moral law'. People 'act out of respect for the moral law' when they act in some way because they have a duty to do so. So, the only thing that is truly good in itself is a good will, and a good will is only good when the willer chooses to do something because it is that person's duty, i.e. out of respect for the law.

It marks the time when all food items, grains, tubers and variety of vegetables from the year-long farming are collected and stored in the Aleh (Granary). Cooking newly harvested rice wrapped in Tszkgh (Phrynium marantaceae leaves) or Saphaye (Aspidistra elatior) leaves in fresh-cut bamboo stems is one of the main rituals symbolizing success of crop cultivation.Ahuna is also a time for charting a new beginning  mapping a blue print of a new area for the next agricultural year called the Asyekithe. For our ancestors, it was a time for serious divination invoking the Alhou (creator) and spirits of nature to show if the next agricultural year would produce a good harvest to sustain the village population. According to the forecasts, measures in the form of precautionary rituals were performed to appease nature spirits to ensure that the next agricultural year would be bountiful. The forecasting ritual is performed after Ahuna rice is consumed. Emptied bamboo tube used for cooking new rice is split into equal halves and thrown in the air with specific incantations, usually performed by Achine-u (priest in the old Smi religion): if both the halves land face-down or face-up, it is a bad omen, however, if one is face-down and the other split side up, it is regarded a sign of good fortune. The old religion has died out a long time now and most rituals forgotten or forbidden. In modern times, throwing of split bamboo during Ahuna is usually done for fun.Traditionally, the Ahuna Tiqhetini was observed for over three days after harvest. In modern times, Ahuna is celebrated as a major public event with an array of cultural activities of traditional songs and dances, traditional sports and different cultural competitions and with traditional food.

This option is attractive because the storage costs are offset by the sale of additional oil that is recovered. Typically, 1015% additional recovery of the original oil in place is possible. Further benefits are the existing infrastructure and the geophysical and geological information about the oil field that is available from the oil exploration. Another benefit of injecting CO into Oil fields is that CO is soluble in oil.  Dissolving CO in oil lowers the viscosity of the oil and reduces its interfacial tension which increases the oils mobility. All oil fields have a geological barrier preventing upward migration of oil. As most oil and gas has been in place for millions to tens of millions of years, depleted oil and gas reservoirs can contain carbon dioxide for millennia. Identified possible problems are the many 'leak' opportunities provided by old oil wells, the need for high injection pressures and acidification which can damage the geological barrier. Other disadvantages of old oil fields are their limited geographic distribution and depths, which require high injection pressures for sequestration.  Below a depth of about 1000 m, carbon dioxide is injected as a supercritical fluid, a material with the density of a liquid, but the viscosity and diffusivity of a gas.Unminable coal seams can be used to store CO, because CO absorbs to the coal surface, ensuring safe long-term storage.  In the process it releases methane that was previously adsorbed to the coal surface and that may be recovered.  Again the sale of the methane can be used to offset the cost of the CO storage. Release or burning of methane would of course at least partially offset the obtained sequestration result  except when the gas is allowed to escape into the atmosphere in significant quantities: methane has a higher global warming potential than CO.",CAR_ef89f01064eadb279a31a6c4d9b39881e0134eb9,0," Edit Your Location.

The WHO states that no severe side effects have been associated with these vaccines, although they can produce mild inflammation at the site of injection. The safety of squalene-containing influenza vaccines have also been tested in two separate clinical trials, one with healthy non-elderly people, and one with elderly people, in both trials the vaccine was safe and well tolerated, with only weak side-effects, such as mild pain at the injection site. A 2009 meta-analysis brought together data from 64 clinical trials of influenza vaccines with the squalene-containing adjuvant MF59 and compared them to the effects of vaccines with no adjuvant. The analysis reported that the adjuvanted vaccines were associated with slightly lower risks of chronic diseases, but that neither type of vaccines altered the normal rate of autoimmune diseases; the authors concluded that their data supports the good safety profile associated with MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccines and suggests there may be a clinical benefit over non-MF59-containing vaccines. A 2004 review of the effects of adjuvants on mice and humans concluded that despite numerous case reports on vaccination induced autoimmunity, most epidemiological studies failed to confirm the association and the risk appears to be extremely low or non-existent, although the authors noted that the possibility that adjuvants might cause damaging immune reactions in a few susceptible people has not been completely ruled out. A 2009 review of oil-based adjuvants in influenza vaccines stated that this type of adjuvant neither stimulates antibodies against squalene oil naturally produced by the humans body nor enhances titers of preexisting antibodies to squalene and that these formulations did not raise any safety concerns.",CAR_eaa080562d4fd60bd1d8a6eb8d7ecf8402d503a6,0," There is some evidence that the oil has anti-inflammatory properties; however, there have not yet been extensive tests, and the USDA regards pure emu oil as an unapproved drug and highlighted it in a 2009 article entitled How to Spot Health Fraud.
