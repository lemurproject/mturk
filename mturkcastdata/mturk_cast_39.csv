This surplus stimulates the activity of osteoclasts, cells that break down bone, in a process known as osteoclastic bone resorption. The hyperparathyroidism can be triggered by a parathyroid adenoma, hereditary factors, parathyroid carcinoma, or renal osteodystrophy.Osteoclastic bone resorption releases minerals, including calcium, from the bone into the bloodstream. In addition to elevated blood calcium levels, over-activity of this process results in a loss of bone mass, a weakening of the bones as their calcified supporting structures are replaced with fibrous tissue (peritrabecular fibrosis), and the formation of cyst-like brown tumors in and around the bone. The symptoms of the disease are the consequences of both the general softening of the bones and the excess calcium in the blood, and include bone fractures, kidney stones, nausea, moth-eaten appearance in the bones, appetite loss, and weight loss.",CAR_5864a0a3cbab8a49370fdee64ecd54f54b9d6cf8,0," Sarakan Toothpaste is vegan, fluoride-free and is flavoured with oil of peppermint, clove and geranium.

According to George, adopting a vegetarianvegan diet poses risks on people identifiable by characteristics over which they have no choice or control: infants, children, adolescents, gestating or lactating women, some elderly people, and many people living in cultural and environmental circumstances that are not dependent on industrialized agriculture and high-tech society. Based on Georges scientific research, she discovered that women and children are more vulnerable to deficiencies of certain vitamins and minerals. Especially children who adopt a vegan diet may lack sufficient quantities of vitamin D and B12, iron, calcium, and zinc. Vegan women may face the risk of being diagnosed with osteoporosis as a result of adopting diets that are low in calcium.

Furthermore, lactating and gestating women may be at greater nutritional risk which may negatively influence the health of the fetus or infant.

Vitamin A deficiency is the shortage of vitamin A or carotenes. The dragon usually obtains vitamin A through the consumption of leafy greens and insects. This deficiency is found typically in tame dragons, since wild dragons have a surplus of greens and insects to eats. The lack of vitamin A can increase the parasitic issues, weakening the immune system, and can lead to the death of the dragon if the diet imbalance is not corrected. The metabolic bone disease is a product of lack of UVB light and calcium. Natural light gives off vitamin D3. This vitamin is vital to break down the calcium the dragon consumes, enhancing the importance of light. The disease can cause soft bones and muscle cramping (Langerwerf, 2006, p. 54-55).

This surplus stimulates the activity of osteoclasts, cells that break down bone, in a process known as osteoclastic bone resorption. The hyperparathyroidism can be triggered by a parathyroid adenoma, hereditary factors, parathyroid carcinoma, or renal osteodystrophy.Osteoclastic bone resorption releases minerals, including calcium, from the bone into the bloodstream. In addition to elevated blood calcium levels, over-activity of this process results in a loss of bone mass, a weakening of the bones as their calcified supporting structures are replaced with fibrous tissue (peritrabecular fibrosis), and the formation of cyst-like brown tumors in and around the bone. The symptoms of the disease are the consequences of both the general softening of the bones and the excess calcium in the blood, and include bone fractures, kidney stones, nausea, moth-eaten appearance in the bones, appetite loss, and weight loss.",CAR_5864a0a3cbab8a49370fdee64ecd54f54b9d6cf8,0," Also, men tend to lose weight where they need it most (read: belly), so it's often more immediately noticeable when overweight men start trimming down than when women do.

According to George, adopting a vegetarianvegan diet poses risks on people identifiable by characteristics over which they have no choice or control: infants, children, adolescents, gestating or lactating women, some elderly people, and many people living in cultural and environmental circumstances that are not dependent on industrialized agriculture and high-tech society. Based on Georges scientific research, she discovered that women and children are more vulnerable to deficiencies of certain vitamins and minerals.

Vegan women may face the risk of being diagnosed with osteoporosis as a result of adopting diets that are low in calcium.

Vitamin A deficiency is the shortage of vitamin A or carotenes. The dragon usually obtains vitamin A through the consumption of leafy greens and insects. This deficiency is found typically in tame dragons, since wild dragons have a surplus of greens and insects to eats. The lack of vitamin A can increase the parasitic issues, weakening the immune system, and can lead to the death of the dragon if the diet imbalance is not corrected. The metabolic bone disease is a product of lack of UVB light and calcium. Natural light gives off vitamin D3. This vitamin is vital to break down the calcium the dragon consumes, enhancing the importance of light. The disease can cause soft bones and muscle cramping (Langerwerf, 2006, p. 54-55).

Battle Creek, Michigan was a center both of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and of innovation in the ready-to-eat cereal industry. And indeed, the church had a substantial impact on the development of cereal goods through the person of John Harvey Kellogg (1851-1943).

Omega-3 EPA prevents AA from being released from membranes, thereby skewing prostaglandin balance away from pro-inflammatory PGE2 (made from AA) toward anti-inflammatory PGE1 (made from DGLA). Moreover, the conversion (desaturation) of DGLA to AA is controlled by the enzyme delta-5-desaturase, which in turn is controlled by hormones such as insulin (up-regulation) and glucagon (down-regulation). The amount and type of carbohydrates consumed, along with some types of amino acid, can influence processes involving insulin, glucagon, and other hormones; therefore the ratio of omega-3 versus omega-6 has wide effects on general health, and specific effects on immune function and inflammation, and mitosis (i.e. cell division).",CAR_80af6a2f4dfcb9cb1f28d0a8557f090d46a752c0,0," There are several arguments from Judaism used by Jewish vegetarians. For the Jewish vegetarian there are three main components which prove vegetarianism to be an ethical mitzvah: Tza'ar ba'alei hayyim, Pikuach nefesh and Bal tashkhit. Tza'ar ba'alei hayyim is the injunction not to cause pain to living creatures. Pikuach nefesh is not only the regard for human life which is in immediate danger. Bal Tashchit is the law which prohibits waste. Another argument is that, since Adam and Eve were not allowed to eat meat and that, according to some opinions, in the Messianic era, the whole world will be vegetarian, not eating meat is something that brings the world closer to that ideal. In his booklet summarizing many of Rav Kooks teachings, Joseph Green, a 20th-century South African Jewish vegetarian writer, concludes that Jewish religious ethical vegetarians are pioneers of the messianic era; they are leading lives that make the coming of the Messiah more likely. The Jewish tradition asserts that one way to speed the coming of the Messiah is to start practicing the ways that will prevail in the messianic time.  A second one is that the laws of shechita are meant to prevent the suffering of animals and today, with factory farming and high-speed, mechanized slaughterhouses, even kosher slaughterhouses are considered by some authorities not to fulfill enough of the requirements to render the meat kosher. Also, even if the slaughtering process is carried out perfectly, with a minimum of pain to the animal, the many months of cruel treatment of animals on factory farms should be considered. A third one is that the Sages only mandated eating an olive's bulk of meat during festivals, but even then, this was because in Talmudic times, meat was considered essential for one's diet.",CAR_811946d5297608bba64eb20610ba2ef342b9cf7c,0,

Behavior changes between bees andor colonies in laboratory or field test conditions versus natural environments also add to the challenges. Studies submitted by Bayer AG to USEPA have provided some useful information about clothianidin's potential long-term effects on honey bees but outstanding questions remain. USEPA's analysis of nine pollinator field studies submitted concluded that three were invalid, so EPA did not use the data they provided in making its regulatory decision for clothianidin. EPA classified the remainder as supplemental, generally because Bayer AG conducted the studies without EPA first approving the protocols. Supplemental studies are ones that don't definitively answer uncertainties but still provide some data that might be useful in characterizing risk. Indicative of the rapid advance of regulators' understanding of pollinator science, USEPA first accepted one of the studies as sound science in 2007, then reclassified it as invalid in November 2010 only to reclassify it as supplemental one month later.

Research suggests that nonverbal and verbal communication between health care professionals and patient can lead to improved patient outcomes. According to Stacks and Salween on page 496 some health care facilities, like hospitals are providing training and education materials to patients. The goal of hospitals doing this is to allow for patients to have a better outcome due to better communication skills.Over the years, there has been much research done on health communication. For example, researchers want to know if people are more effectively motivated by a positive message versus a negative message.

Researchers are examining which dimensions of persuasive incentives are most influential: physical health versus economic, versus psychological, versus moral, versus social.

In digital electronics, a stream of binary values is represented by a voltage (or current) waveform.  However, digital signals are fundamentally analog in nature, and all signals are subject to effects such as noise, distortion, and loss. Over short distances and at low bit rates, a simple conductor can transmit this with sufficient fidelity. At high bit rates and over longer distances or through various mediums, various effects can degrade the electrical signal to the point where errors occur and the system or device fails.  Signal integrity engineering is the task of analyzing and mitigating these effects. It is an important activity at all levels of electronics packaging and assembly, from internal connections of an integrated circuit (IC), through the package, the printed circuit board (PCB), the backplane, and inter-system connections.  While there are some common themes at these various levels, there are also practical considerations, in particular the interconnect flight time versus the bit period, that cause substantial differences in the approach to signal integrity for on-chip connections versus chip-to-chip connections.",CAR_c7f7621412ecb4ae91fd215b985804b4b2a1169e,0," Non-dairy milks that are fortified with calcium, such as soymilk and almond milk can also contribute a significant amount of calcium in the diet.

The EPIC-Oxford study suggested that vegans who consumed 525 mg or less of calcium per day have an increased risk of bone fractures over meat eaters and vegetarians, but that vegans consuming more than 525 mgday had a risk of fractures similar to other groups. Overall, the entire group of vegans had a higher risk of fractures.

Another study in 2009 by the same researchers examined over 100 vegan post-menopausal women, and found that their diet had no adverse effect on bone mineral density (BMD) and no alteration in body composition. Biochemist T. Colin Campbell suggested in The China Study (2005) that osteoporosis is linked to the consumption of animal protein because, unlike plant protein, animal protein increases the acidity of blood and tissues, which is then neutralized by calcium pulled from the bones resulting in hypercalciuria. Campbell wrote that his China-Oxford-Cornell study of nutrition in the 1970s and 1980s found that, in rural China, where the animal to plant ratio for protein was about 10 percent, the fracture rate is only one-fifth that of the U.S.",CAR_0ea577fbfa56a4bf4a70dba137662fbe9ed4bfef,0," Historian of religion Cameron Wybrow wrote a review of Edge of Evolution published in The Philadelphia Inquirer, stating that the book provides some hard numbers, coupled with an ingenious argument.

An interplay of these three mechanisms underlies the development of fragile bone tissue. Hormonal factors strongly determine the rate of bone resorption; lack of estrogen (e.g. as a result of menopause) increases bone resorption, as well as decreasing the deposition of new bone that normally takes place in weight-bearing bones. The amount of estrogen needed to suppress this process is lower than that normally needed to stimulate the uterus and breast gland. The -form of the estrogen receptor appears to be the most important in regulating bone turnover. In addition to estrogen, calcium metabolism plays a significant role in bone turnover, and deficiency of calcium and vitamin D leads to impaired bone deposition; in addition, the parathyroid glands react to low calcium levels by secreting parathyroid hormone (parathormone, PTH), which increases bone resorption to ensure sufficient calcium in the blood. The role of calcitonin, a hormone generated by the thyroid that increases bone deposition, is less clear and probably not as significant as that of PTH.",CAR_1dbff99d65b2bb7a5ea67349101e157bf27f73c5,0," Some people who experience increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation are astronauts.

It does not provide information on bone quality, another important parameter to describe the bone. In addition, clinical risk factors for fracture are at best an indirect assessment of the bone quality. One way to describe the quality of the bone is to assess its microarchitecture. Bone microarchitecture is related to the mechanical strength of bone and hence its greater or lesser risk of fracture. Indeed, for the same quantity of bone, different mechanically resistant bone structures may exist (few large trabeculae or numerous thin trabeculae that are mechanically stronger). Actually, bone loss is often accompanied by a deterioration of bone architecture, resulted in a decreased number of trabeculae, increased inter-trabecular distances, and a loss connectivity of the trabecular meshwork.

The National Osteoporosis Foundation states, Calcium plays an important role in building stronger, denser bones early in life and keeping bones strong and healthy later in life. Approximately 99 percent of the calcium in the human body is in the bones and teeth. The rest of the calcium in the body has other important uses, such as some exocytosis, especially neurotransmitter release, and muscle contraction. Intracellular calcium overload may lead some kind of cells to oxidative stress and apoptosis, and produces several diseases. In the electrical conduction system of the heart, calcium replaces sodium as the mineral that depolarizes the cell, proliferating the action potential. In cardiac muscle, sodium influx commences an action potential, but during potassium efflux, the cardiac myocyte experiences calcium influx, prolonging the action potential and creating a plateau phase of dynamic equilibrium. Long-term calcium deficiency can lead to rickets and poor blood clotting; in menopausal women, deficiency can lead to osteoporosis, a condition in which the bone deteriorates and fractures more readily. While a lifelong deficit can affect bone and tooth formation, over-retention can cause hypercalcemia (elevated levels of calcium in the blood), impaired kidney function, and decreased absorption of other minerals.

An interplay of these three mechanisms underlies the development of fragile bone tissue. Hormonal factors strongly determine the rate of bone resorption; lack of estrogen (e.g. as a result of menopause) increases bone resorption, as well as decreasing the deposition of new bone that normally takes place in weight-bearing bones. The amount of estrogen needed to suppress this process is lower than that normally needed to stimulate the uterus and breast gland. The -form of the estrogen receptor appears to be the most important in regulating bone turnover. In addition to estrogen, calcium metabolism plays a significant role in bone turnover, and deficiency of calcium and vitamin D leads to impaired bone deposition; in addition, the parathyroid glands react to low calcium levels by secreting parathyroid hormone (parathormone, PTH), which increases bone resorption to ensure sufficient calcium in the blood. The role of calcitonin, a hormone generated by the thyroid that increases bone deposition, is less clear and probably not as significant as that of PTH.",CAR_1dbff99d65b2bb7a5ea67349101e157bf27f73c5,0,

The National Osteoporosis Foundation states, Calcium plays an important role in building stronger, denser bones early in life and keeping bones strong and healthy later in life. Approximately 99 percent of the calcium in the human body is in the bones and teeth. The rest of the calcium in the body has other important uses, such as some exocytosis, especially neurotransmitter release, and muscle contraction. Intracellular calcium overload may lead some kind of cells to oxidative stress and apoptosis, and produces several diseases. In the electrical conduction system of the heart, calcium replaces sodium as the mineral that depolarizes the cell, proliferating the action potential. In cardiac muscle, sodium influx commences an action potential, but during potassium efflux, the cardiac myocyte experiences calcium influx, prolonging the action potential and creating a plateau phase of dynamic equilibrium. Long-term calcium deficiency can lead to rickets and poor blood clotting; in menopausal women, deficiency can lead to osteoporosis, a condition in which the bone deteriorates and fractures more readily. While a lifelong deficit can affect bone and tooth formation, over-retention can cause hypercalcemia (elevated levels of calcium in the blood), impaired kidney function, and decreased absorption of other minerals.

These ensure the harvest is sustainable and humane.A wide cross section of Australian ecologists support the kangaroo industry as being both sustainable and environmentally wise.  Many argue kangaroos, which are native to Australia, are a more environmentally friendly livestock option than introduced sheep and cattle.  The two most important facets of Kangaroos' better ecological fit than European agricultural animals relate to their adaptation to Australia's aridity.  Kangaroos have small chest development and so require less water to breathe than placental mammals, which usually must expand a diaphragm. This means they lose more moisture in respiration. Kangaroos just make small pants while immobile and in motion expand and contract their lungs effectively using their leg muscles. The belly flops up and down, contracting and expanding the lungs respectively.  Also, the kangaroo's paw is softer and does not compact the ground as hoofed cattle and sheep do. Instead, its hopping leaves very small bowl-shaped cuts in the surface of even dry clay soil, which let native grass seeds carried on the wind settle into them. The bowl shape concentrates any moisture that may fall into it into a wet point that the grass seed can use to germinate.  Thus, kangaroos deplete the water table at a slower rate than cattle or sheep and would even be viable in the absence of any bore water at all.  The ecological arguments for kangaroos replacing sheep and cattle as arid land livestock are compelling, though they must be set against objections of kangaroos' lack of domestication and breeding rate.Kangaroos are eaten in most states.",CAR_2468165afdc412407a64cf9ca1f442c0e4f32204,0," This term is often used in a derogatory way in reference to the anti-consumerism present in the environmental movement.

As the ideal images of the Torah are vegetarian, it is natural to similarly see the laws of kashrut as actually designed to wean Jews away from meat eating and to move them toward the vegetarian ideal. The rituals of kashrut remind us of the magnitude of what we do each time we kill a living being. Other commentators argue that people may eat animals because God gave Adam and Eve dominion over them.

Arguments must be distinguished from adjuncts. While a predicate needs its arguments to complete its meaning, the adjuncts that appear with a predicate are optional; they are not necessary to complete the meaning of the predicate.

It is recognised that environmental problems cannot be solved by government alone. Participation in environmental decision-making effectively links the public to environmental governance. By involving the public, who are at the root of both causes and solutions of environmental problems, in environmental discussions, transparency and accountability are more likely to be achieved, thus secures the democratic legitimacy of decision-making that good environmental governance depends on. Arguably, a strong public participation in environmental governance could increase the commitment among stockholders, which strengthens the compliance and enforcement of environmental laws. GIS can provide a valuable tool for such work (see GIS and environmental governance). In addition, some opponents argue that the right to participate in environmental decision-making is a procedural right that can be seen as part of the fundamental right to environmental protection. From this ethical perspective, environmental governance is expected to operate within a framework coinciding the constitutional principle of fairness (inclusive of equality), which inevitably requires the fulfillment of environmental rights and ultimately calls for the engagement of public. Further, in the context of considerable scientific uncertainties surrounding environmental issues, public participation helps to counter such uncertainties and bridges the gap between scientifically-defined environmental problems and the experiences and values of stakeholders.

Whereas theoretical arguments make inferences based on a set of principles to arrive at a claim, practical arguments first find a claim of interest, and then provide justification for it.

Cipher's early politics were not born out of a coherent ideology.   Their earliest recordings include vague anti-authoritarian statements and ruminations on metaphysical themes.  These records provide insights into Cipher's future political leanings but are notably unrefined in their execution.  Although never explicitly a straightedge band, all four original band members either identified as straightedge or led a drug-free lifestyle, independent of straightedge culture and politics.  To this day both Danny Cipher and Moe Cipher continue to lead striaghtedge  drug-free lifestyles.  Although not explicitly a vegan or vegetarian band, three of the four original band members were either vegan or vegetarian.  To this day Moe Cipher maintains a vegan lifestyle.  In 1998 Cipher's music took on a distinctly revolutionary racial consciousness and an explicitly anti-racist bent.  By 2000 Cipher's politics had become more oppositional in nature and more urgent in its push for dramatic social change.  At this point, Cipher's politics had matured to a balanced challenge of race, class, and gender in contemporary society.  The most noticeable shift in this period of Cipher's political development was a pronounced gender critique.  This enhanced feminist critique is most noticeable on songs like Woman, featured on Antidote.  By 2005 Cipher had adopted on a total-liberation ethos, exposing a need for total social upheaval in order to develop a new society that respected the autonomy of all living beings, human and animal as well as the Earth's environment.  Cipher's political message promotes animal rights although not all the current members of Cipher are vegan.  This represents a continuation of the politics Cipher had in its inception when most members were vegan or vegetarian.  Additionally, their understanding of a revolutionary future would not necessitate all humanity to align under ridged guidelines of behavior.  Cipher suggests a path to total liberation in stages.

The weakness of the concept is that it requirescalculating the maximum sustainable consumption rate of each differentresource globally. This rate could be set by either the maximum sustainableyield (say for forests or fisheries) or the assimilative capacity of theenvironment (e.g. for  or chlorine), but both quantities are very difficult to determine, so the 'environmental space' has rather large error limits and is therefore hard to defend in policy discussions. A further difficulty isthat there is a different 'environmental space' for each kind of resource,and as they each necessarily have different units of measure, they cannot beadded to get an overall environmental space for all the resources consumed by a country. Theidea of environmental space was promoted quite strongly by Friends of the Earth Europe in themid-1990s, but it is rarely used now, because of the aforementioned difficulties, and has essentially been superseded by 'ecological footprint'.

These ensure the harvest is sustainable and humane.A wide cross section of Australian ecologists support the kangaroo industry as being both sustainable and environmentally wise.  Many argue kangaroos, which are native to Australia, are a more environmentally friendly livestock option than introduced sheep and cattle.  The two most important facets of Kangaroos' better ecological fit than European agricultural animals relate to their adaptation to Australia's aridity.  Kangaroos have small chest development and so require less water to breathe than placental mammals, which usually must expand a diaphragm. This means they lose more moisture in respiration. Kangaroos just make small pants while immobile and in motion expand and contract their lungs effectively using their leg muscles. The belly flops up and down, contracting and expanding the lungs respectively.  Also, the kangaroo's paw is softer and does not compact the ground as hoofed cattle and sheep do. Instead, its hopping leaves very small bowl-shaped cuts in the surface of even dry clay soil, which let native grass seeds carried on the wind settle into them. The bowl shape concentrates any moisture that may fall into it into a wet point that the grass seed can use to germinate.  Thus, kangaroos deplete the water table at a slower rate than cattle or sheep and would even be viable in the absence of any bore water at all.  The ecological arguments for kangaroos replacing sheep and cattle as arid land livestock are compelling, though they must be set against objections of kangaroos' lack of domestication and breeding rate.Kangaroos are eaten in most states.",CAR_2468165afdc412407a64cf9ca1f442c0e4f32204,0," This is the purpose of an argument: to offer reasons and evidence for the purpose of establishing the truth value of a proposition, which can mean either establishing that the proposition is true or establishing that the proposition is false.If a series of statements does not do this, it isnt an argument.he claim, in turn, is the conclusion: what you finish with at the end of an argument.

Therefore, the consumption of correctly-balanced foods and life-style of the patient was crucial to the prevention and treatment of disease in Ancient Greece.This brings us to the way in which seasonal food played an important role in the treatment of ancient disease. According to the Hippocratic author of Airs, Waters and Places (there remains debate as to whether Hippocrates himself wrote the Hippocratic Corpus), it is important that a physician learn astronomy because, the changes of the seasons produce changes in diseases,. In the same Hippocratic text, the author goes on to explain that villages facing east and that are exposed to winds from the north-east, south-east and west tended to be healthy and, The climate in such a district may be compared with the spring in that there are no extremes of heat and cold. As a consequence, diseases in such a district are few and not severe,. As an example of the importance of seasonal food on maintaining balance of the humours and preventing disease is given by Hippocrates in On Regimen when the authors state that, in winter, to secure a dry and hot body it is better to eat wheaten bread, roast meat, and few vegetables; whereas in summer it is appropriate to eat barley cake, barley meat and softer foods, (qtd. in Wilkins et al., p. 346).",CAR_988470df98678355085f0b4d903eec543fdd47c7,0," In 1972, Croce signed a three-record contract with ABC Records, releasing two albums, You Don't Mess Around with Jim and Life and Times.

For example, a DEFRA report in 2005 undertaken by researchers at AEA Technology Environment, entitled The Validity of Food Miles as an Indicator of Sustainable Development, included findings that the direct environmental, social and economic costs of food transport are over 9 billion each year, and are dominated by congestion. The report also indicates that it is not only how far the food has travelled but the method of travel in all parts of the food chain that is important to consider. Many trips by personal cars to shopping centres would have a negative environmental impact compared to transporting a few truckloads to neighbourhood stores that can be easily reached by walking or cycling. More emissions are created by the drive to the supermarket to buy air freighted food than was created by the air freighting in the first place. Also, the positive environmental effects of organic farming may be compromised by increased transportation, unless it is produced by local farms.  The Carbon Trust notes that to understand the carbon emissions from food production, all the carbon-emitting processes that occur as a result of getting food from the field to our plates need to be considered, including production, origin, seasonality and home care.",CAR_468abc944661f3869f126ff146b96dfe7b3050e8,0," This is a list of vegetarian and vegan festivals.

According to George, adopting a vegetarianvegan diet poses risks on people identifiable by characteristics over which they have no choice or control: infants, children, adolescents, gestating or lactating women, some elderly people, and many people living in cultural and environmental circumstances that are not dependent on industrialized agriculture and high-tech society. Based on Georges scientific research, she discovered that women and children are more vulnerable to deficiencies of certain vitamins and minerals.

Vegan women may face the risk of being diagnosed with osteoporosis as a result of adopting diets that are low in calcium.

Furthermore, lactating and gestating women may be at greater nutritional risk which may negatively influence the health of the fetus or infant.

For the Jewish vegetarian there are three main components which prove vegetarianism to be an ethical mitzvah: Tza'ar ba'alei hayyim, Pikuach nefesh and Bal tashkhit. Tza'ar ba'alei hayyim is the injunction not to cause pain to living creatures. Pikuach nefesh is not only the regard for human life which is in immediate danger. Bal Tashchit is the law which prohibits waste. Another argument is that, since Adam and Eve were not allowed to eat meat and that, according to some opinions, in the Messianic era, the whole world will be vegetarian, not eating meat is something that brings the world closer to that ideal. In his booklet summarizing many of Rav Kooks teachings, Joseph Green, a 20th-century South African Jewish vegetarian writer, concludes that Jewish religious ethical vegetarians are pioneers of the messianic era; they are leading lives that make the coming of the Messiah more likely. The Jewish tradition asserts that one way to speed the coming of the Messiah is to start practicing the ways that will prevail in the messianic time.  A second one is that the laws of shechita are meant to prevent the suffering of animals and today, with factory farming and high-speed, mechanized slaughterhouses, even kosher slaughterhouses are considered by some authorities not to fulfill enough of the requirements to render the meat kosher. Also, even if the slaughtering process is carried out perfectly, with a minimum of pain to the animal, the many months of cruel treatment of animals on factory farms should be considered. A third one is that the Sages only mandated eating an olive's bulk of meat during festivals, but even then, this was because in Talmudic times, meat was considered essential for one's diet.",CAR_811946d5297608bba64eb20610ba2ef342b9cf7c,0," The lack of knowledge about nematode ecology has resulted in unanticipated failures to control pests in the field.

Comparing the life histories of nematodes and target pests can often explain such failures (Gaugler et al. 1997).

These studies show that there is not yet a consistent methodology for measuring energy consumption in local versus non-local farms. Local is not a clearly defined measurement, and by only examining the energy in terms of food miles versus an entire life cycle assessment (LCA), much of the research on local farming is missing key components of the farm-to-consumer process, and the energy consumption involved. For example, despite the amount of greenhouse gases emitted from transporting farm foods to consumers, agricultural soils are also responsible for releasing significant amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere (Schlesinger).The life cycle assessment attempts to measure the impacts of each activity directly or indirectly involved in the production, transport, storage, retail, consumption and disposal of a particular food from farm to fork or farm to waste. Studies that examine the LCA still show that there is no clear conclusion on the environmental impact of local versus non-local agriculture. A study in Sweden that examined bread production using local flour versus flour from other regions in Sweden found that the smaller scale of local farms results in less energy efficiency5.  Another study supports this argument that global food systems have better energy efficiency due to the size of production, the so-called ecology-of-scale.
