Frida Kahlo's Symbolist works also relate strongly to Surrealism and to the Magic Realism movement in literature. The psychological drama in many of Kahlo's self-portraits (above) underscore the vitality and relevance of her paintings to artists in the 21st century.",CAR_1728a5ae906f1ba513370aa2f17b9bd78f2543d5,0," Marcel Duchamp, came to international prominence in the wake of his notorious success at the New York City Armory Show in 1913, (soon after he denounced artmaking for chess). After Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase became the international cause celebre at the 1913 Armory show in New York he created the The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, Large Glass. The Large Glass pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp became closely associated with the Dada movement that began in neutral Zurich, Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Francis Picabia (see above), Man Ray, Kurt Schwitters, Tristan Tzara, Hans Richter, Jean Arp, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several Dadaists are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.In 1924 Andr Breton published the Surrealist Manifesto. The Surrealist movement in painting became synonymous with the avant-garde and which featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like Machine Turn Quickly, (above) Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the Dada movement through 1919 in Zurich and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in Surrealist art. Yves Tanguy, Ren Magritte and Salvador Dal are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. Joan Mir's The Tilled Field of 19231924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Mir's first Surrealist masterpiece. Mir's The Tilled Field also contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work that Mir saw as a young painter in The Prado. The more abstract Joan Mir, Jean Arp, Andr Masson, and Max Ernst were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A Surrealist group developed in Britain and, according to Breton, their 1936 London International Surrealist Exhibition was a high water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Surrealist groups in Japan, and especially in Latin America, the Caribbean and in Mexico produced innovative and original works.",CAR_20a583f089d37ce85e0c3bd091456fc1159c8508,0," Modernist sculpture movements include Art Nouveau, Cubism, Geometric abstraction, De Stijl, Suprematism, Constructivism, Dadaism, Surrealism, Futurism, Formalism Abstract expressionism, Pop-Art, Minimalism, Postminimalism, Land art, Conceptual art, and Installation art among others.",CAR_2a5bc0603159c70ac07bc6e2b173f2d282c3d62b,0," While broadly based, the movement was unstable.

Beginning in the 1930s, artists searched for a style that would differentiate themselves from the dreamlike surrealism of Europe and more sub-conscious, earlier movements of Romanticism and Modernism. This new form of Americana Dream art began in Los Angeles, California. The cities' fanciful, other-worldly architecture and extravagant city-scape provided ample inspiration for burgeoning artists. Other cities such as San Francisco, New York, and Dallas became hotbeds for these creators.",CAR_2e1ed176ecc4643947eb30cee998a11c7b2d70dc,0," Throughout the span of his life Antoni Tpies has been associated with a number movements such as Art Informel and Haute Pte or Matter Painting.  He became a part of the avant-garde group Dau al Set in 1948 which was a group that had strong ties to Surrealism.  Early works of his were surrealistic, but in 1953 he began working in abstract art.  It is here that he becomes a part of the Art Informel movement and starts working with mixed media. Art Informel in Europe was the equivalent to Abstract Expressionism in America.  This was among the most prevalent styles of art in post-war Europe.  Within this movement is the category of Matter Painting.  Its focus on the use of odd objects completely undermines the acts of traditional fine art.  Some of Tpies's most famous and original works fall within this genre.  They are characterized by his use of marble dust and clay that he mixed with his paints as well as the incorporation of found objects such as string, paper, and cloth.  In the late 1960's into the early 1970's Tpies began to be influenced by the movement of Pop Art.  Because of this he began using larger items, such as pieces of furniture, in his works.",CAR_2f86f2d2587dedda30df60cc87b5cd0f03f84985,0," 20th-century French art developed out of the Impressionism and Post-Impressionism that dominated French art at the end of the 19th century. The first half of the 20th century in France saw the even more revolutionary experiments of Cubism, Dada and Surrealism, artistic movements that would have a major impact on western, and eventually world, art. After World War II, while French artists explored such tendencies as Tachism, Fluxus and New realism, France's preeminence in the visual arts progressively became eclipsed by developments elsewhere (the United States in particular).",CAR_31b743bd021022de69ed4cb5516d4e7ee301aefd,0," In the early 20th century, during his period of cubist innovation, Pablo Picasso revolutionized the art of sculpture when he began creating his constructions fashioned by combining disparate objects and materials into one constructed piece of sculpture; Picasso reinvented the art of sculpture with his innovative use of constructing a work in three dimensions with disparate material, the sculptural equivalent of the collage in two-dimensional art. Just as collage was a radical development in two-dimensional art; so was construction a radical development in three-dimensional sculpture. The advent of Surrealism led to things occasionally being described as sculpture that would not have been so previously, such as involuntary sculpture in several senses, including coulage. In later years Picasso became a prolific potter, leading, with interest in historic pottery from around the world, to a revival of  ceramic art, with figures such as George E. Ohr and subsequently Peter Voulkos, Kenneth Price, and Robert Arneson. Marcel Duchamp originated the use of the found object (French: objet trouv) or readymade with pieces such as Fountain (1917).",CAR_331ab9a3c00ee10f6b7713654be451493d4ee2c2,0,,

This was the basis for Concrete art and Surrealism which became the latest trend in the international Avant-garde movement. The association of Abstraction and Surrealism was pioneered by Vilhelm Bjerke-Petersen who in 1930 joined the Bauhaus School in Weimar, a key Avant-garde institution which revolutionized not just painting but architecture, sculpture, literature, theatre and dance. Bauhaus is remembered for its influence on Abstract art and Functionalist architecture and design. At the Bauhaus, Bjerke Petersen had studied under Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee and was thus familiar with contemporary theories of abstract art. This led to the publication in 1933 of Symboler i abstrakt kunst (Symbols in Abstract Art) which served as a manifesto for the movement in Denmark.",CAR_355d77842d4050553c2fa7e7cd694f927ff6926f,0," Francis Picabia (; born Francis-Marie Martinez de Picabia, 22January 1879  30November 1953) was a French avant-garde painter, poet and typographist. After experimenting with Impressionism and Pointillism, Picabia became associated with Cubism. His highly abstract planar compositions were colourful and rich in contrasts. He was one of the early major figures of the Dada movement in the United States and in France. He was later briefly associated with Surrealism, but would soon turn his back on the art establishment.",CAR_378cebfd1fd842160ab41af77ff5647d4983fb8d,0," Expressionism is notoriously difficult to define, in part because it overlapped with other major 'isms' of the modernist period: with Futurism, Vorticism, Cubism, Surrealism and Dada. Richard Murphy also comments: the search for an all-inclusive definition is problematic to the extent that the most challenging expressionists such as the novelist Franz Kafka, poet Gottfried Benn, and novelist Alfred Dblin were simultaneously the most vociferous anti-expressionists. What, however, can be said, is that it was a movement that developed in the early 20th century mainly in Germany in reaction to the dehumanizing effect of industrialization and the growth of cities, and that one of the central means by which expressionism identifies itself as an avant-garde movement, and by which it marks its distance to traditions and the cultural institution as a whole is through its relationship to realism and the dominant conventions of representation. More explicitly: that the expressionists rejected the ideology of realism. ",CAR_37caedbba0f05ea069e8d4e5cbb842ecf05be403,0," Surrealism is often classified as a form of Modern Art. However, the Surrealists themselves have objected to the study of surrealism as an era in art history, claiming that it oversimplifies the complexity of the movement (which they say is not an artistic movement), misrepresents the relationship of surrealism to aesthetics, and falsely characterizes ongoing surrealism as a finished, historically encapsulated era. Other forms of Modern art (some of which border on Contemporary art) include:",CAR_383af5b203a51b3035cee1cddc0dd711c368d7a1,0," The First World War generated even more radical tendencies.  The Dada movementwhich began in a caf in Switzerland in 1916came to Paris in 1920, but by 1924 the writers around Paul luard, Andr Breton, Louis Aragon and Robert Desnosheavily influenced by Sigmund Freud's notion of the unconscioushad modified dada provocation into Surrealism.  In writing and in the visual arts, and by using automatic writing, creative games (like the cadavre exquis) and altered states (through alcohol and narcotics), the surrealists tried to reveal the workings of the unconscious mind.  The group championed previous writers they saw as radical (Arthur Rimbaud, the Comte de Lautramont, Baudelaire) and promoted an anti-bourgeois philosophy (particularly with regards to sex and politics) which would later lead most of them to join the communist party.  Other writers associated with surrealism include: Jean Cocteau, Ren Crevel, Jacques Prvert, Jules Supervielle, Benjamin Pret, Philippe Soupault, Pierre Reverdy, Antonin Artaud (who revolutionized theater), Henri Michaux and Ren Char.

He worked in a wide variety of formats, from his first job illustrating the parlor game Old Maid, to illustrated newspaper strips of which he was a master. His illustrations for Le Diable  Paris (The Devil In Paris; 184446) were used by Walter Benjamin for his study of that city as an urban organism. One of Grandville's supreme achievements, at a time when French printing technology was ascendant, was Les Fleurs Animes, a series of images that are both poetic and satirical. But perhaps his most original contribution to the illustrated book form was Un Autre Monde, which approaches the status of pure surrealism, despite being conceived in a pre-Freudian age. Leading members of the Surrealist movement such as Andr Breton and Georges Bataille recognised in Grandville a significant precursor and inspiration for the movement.",CAR_3adf778eb67619b7dd921b3e8850e716dedf05bb,0," Painting has continued to be a prominent form of artistic expression in Danish culture, inspired by and also influencing major international trends in this area. This includes impressionism and the modernist styles of expressionism, abstract painting and surrealism. While international co-operation and activity has almost always been essential to the Danish artistic community, influential art collectives with a firm Danish base includes De Tretten (19091912), Linien (1930s and 1940s), COBRA (194851), Fluxus (1960s and 1970s), De Unge Vilde (1980s) and more recently Superflex (founded in 1993). Most Danish painters of modern times has also been very active with other forms of artistic expressions, such as sculpting, ceramics, art installations, activism, film and experimental architecture. Notable Danish painters from modern times representing various art movements includes Theodor Philipsen (18401920, impressionism and naturalism), Anna Klindt Srensen (18991985, expressionism), Franciska Clausen (18991986, Neue Sachlichkeit, cubism, surrealism and others), Henry Heerup (19071993, naivism), Robert Jacobsen (19121993, abstract painting), Carl Henning Pedersen (19132007, abstract painting), Asger Jorn (19141973, Situationist, abstract painting), Bjrn Wiinblad (19182006, art deco, orientalism), Per Kirkeby (b. 1938, neo-expressionism, abstract painting), Per Arnoldi (b. 1941, pop art), Michael Kvium (b. 1955, neo-surrealism) and Simone Aaberg Krn (b. 1969, superrealism).",CAR_3e2fa5a1562425d2e532238b02b70bcd553d9574,0," Lowbrow is also commonly referred to as pop surrealism. The term pop surrealism was coined by The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum for its 1998 exhibit of the same name. The exhibit featured work by over seventy artists, including Gregory Crewdson, Mariko Mori, Ashley Bickerton, Art Spiegelman, Tony Oursler, and Cindy Sherman, and was memorialized in the 1999 book of the same name. Reviewing the exhibition for ArtForum, Steven Henry Madoff wrote: The mutant sensibility at work in this droll, smartly curated exhibition proposes the marriage of Surrealism's dream-laden fetish for the body eroticized and grotesque and Pop art's celebration of the shallower, corrosively bright world given over the packaged good. The New York Times said of the exhibit at first, Surrealism and popular culture would seem to be oil and water. Surrealism mines dreams and the unconscious, while popular culture is concerned with surface and commonplaces. But in recent years they have been brought together in exhibitions concerned with proving that High and Low are related. Kirsten Anderson, who edited a second book called Pop Surrealism, considers lowbrow and pop surrealism to be related but distinct movements.

He studied cubism, surrealism and was introduced to new American art by his wife the sculptor Flora Macdonald. He moved towards abstraction, attempting to utilise aspects of landscape, poetry and Celtic art. His most significant work, A Point in Time (192938), has been described by art historian Duncan Macmillan as one of the most important Scottish pictures of the century and one of the most remarkable pictures by any British painter in the period. Stanley Cursiter (18871976) was influenced by the Celtic revival, post-impressionism and Futurism. Later in his career he became a major painter of the coastline of this native Orkney. Other artists strongly influenced by modernism included James McIntosh Patrick (190798) and Edward Baird (190449). Both trained in Glasgow, but spent most of their careers in and around their respective native cities of Dundee and Montrose.

Deaths and the success of the Nazi party in 1933 dominated the negative iconography Fick developed. His dark works in which human simulacra float in a void and where life is played on or by a checkered board, were influenced by Surrealism, Neue Sachlichkeit and the Cologne Progressives. Although it was a personally sad and politically oppressive time, Fick's career prospered. He was a member of the Werkbund bildender KnstlerAssociation of Progressive Artists, exhibited at the Klnisher KunstvereinCologne Art Institute, Becker and Newmann Gallery and with Johanna Ey, known as Mother Ey in Dusseldorf.

Western art schools were institutionalised and taught a variety of styles including Abstractionalism, New-Objectitivism, Neoclassicism, Cubism, Surrealism, Expressionism, Structuralism, Fauvism, Symbolism, Pop Art, Minimalism, Optical Art, and so on.  This brought about a revival of the Taiwanese Nativist art movement, in which Wu was extremely influential. In 1964, Wu joined the Modern Print Society and began to produce woodblock prints. The artist temporarily abandoned oil painting, as he believed that woodblock printing was a more successful method for capturing the Orients qualities, characteristics and identity.  The movement is thought to have emerged in 1949, and was typified by a deliberate rejection of Western art techniques that were initially introduced to Taiwan by the Japanese throughout their colonial rule. Furthermore, the movement aimed to portray indigenous Taiwanese cultural forms and their relationship to the Taiwanese social, economic, cultural and political identity.   Wu employed Nativism in his artwork to exert and explore national Taiwanese characteristics, particularly throughout the 1960s and 1970s when the movement was fruitfully revitalised. An example of this can be seen in Wus 1967 woodblock print entitled Playing Music (annex 1).",CAR_97a2b49708c63015f2e971d6a6007e59f3824ba4,0," La Luz de Jesus Gallery is a commercial art gallery located in Los Angeles, California.

Graham from Russia. Graham's influence on American art during the early 1940s was particularly visible in the work of Arshile Gorky, Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, and Richard Pousette-Dart among others. Gorky's contributions to American and world art are difficult to overestimate. His work as lyrical abstraction was a new language. He lit the way for two generations of American artists. The painterly spontaneity of mature works such as The Liver is the Cock's Comb, The Betrothal II, and One Year the Milkweed immediately prefigured Abstract expressionism, and leaders in the New York School have acknowledged Gorky's considerable influence. The early work of Hyman Bloom was also influential. American artists also benefited from the presence of Piet Mondrian, Fernand Lger, Max Ernst, and the Andr Breton group, Pierre Matisse's gallery, and Peggy Guggenheim's gallery The Art of This Century, as well as other factors. Hans Hofmann in particular as teacher, mentor, and artist was both important and influential to the development and success of Abstract Expressionism in the United States.

In writing and in the visual arts, and by using automatic writing, creative games (like the cadavre exquis) and altered states (through alcohol and narcotics), the surrealists tried to reveal the workings of the unconscious mind.  The group championed previous writers they saw as radical (Arthur Rimbaud, the Comte de Lautramont, Baudelaire, Raymond Roussel) and promoted an anti-bourgeois philosophy (particularly with regards to sex and politics) which would later lead most of them to join the communist party.

Richardson writes: Within popular conceptions, surrealism is misunderstood in many different ways, some of which contradict others, but all of these misunderstandings are founded in the fact that they seek to reduce surrealism to a style or a thing in itself rather than being prepared to see it as an activity with broadening horizons. Many critics fail to recognize the distinctive qualities that make up the surrealist attitude. They seek something  a theme, a particular type of imagery, certain concepts  they can identify as 'surrealist' in order to provide a criterion of judgement by which a film or artwork can be appraised. The problem is that this goes against the very essence of surrealism, which refuses to be here but is always elsewhere. It is not a thing but a relation between things and therefore needs to be treated as a whole. Surrealists are not concerned with conjuring up some magic world that can be defined as 'surreal'. Their interest is almost exclusively in exploring the conjunctions, the points of contact, between different realms of existence. Surrealism is always about departures rather than arrivals.

Many important artists fled to North America, and relative safety in the United States. The art community in New York City in particular was already grappling with Surrealist ideas and several artists like Arshile Gorky, Jackson Pollock, and Robert Motherwell converged closely with the surrealist artists themselves, albeit with some suspicion and reservations. Ideas concerning the unconscious and dream imagery were quickly embraced. By the Second World War, the taste of the American avant-garde in New York City swung decisively towards Abstract Expressionism with the support of key taste makers, including Peggy Guggenheim, Leo Steinberg and Clement Greenberg. However, it should not be easily forgotten that Abstract Expressionism itself grew directly out of the meeting of American (particularly New York) artists with European Surrealists self-exiled during World War II. In particular, Gorky and Paalen influenced the development of this American art form, which, as Surrealism did, celebrated the instantaneous human act as the well-spring of creativity. The early work of many Abstract Expressionists reveals a tight bond between the more superficial aspects of both movements, and the emergence (at a later date) of aspects of Dadaistic humor in such artists as Rauschenberg sheds an even starker light upon the connection. Up until the emergence of Pop Art, Surrealism can be seen to have been the single most important influence on the sudden growth in American arts, and even in Pop, some of the humor manifested in Surrealism can be found, often turned to a cultural criticism.",CAR_b9b782041a95631ab74c8efffd510dda98e58697,0," The effect of the pamphlet was twofold; on the one hand, it brought considerable attention to the movement of surrealism and its aims; but on the other, its disrespectful nature alienated certain sympathizers of the movement, such as the designer and art-collector Jacques Doucet, who until then had been a primary sponsor of the group, and was prompted into a parting of ways.",CAR_bc25d7916b5b5f2992a86c93314c9c5928622aa8,0," Lori Earley was born in Rye, New York.

She served as President of the American Comparative Literature Association from 1977 to 1980 and was a longtime leader in the International Comparative Literature Association. The author of numerous acclaimed books and articles, she was the recipient of many awards. Of Armenian descent, Anna Balakian was born in Constantinople, Istanbul. At the age of 11 she moved with her family to New Britain, Connecticut. She earned the bachelor's degree at Hunter College, the master's and doctorate degree at Columbia University. While in graduate school, she taught French literature and language full-time at the Hunter College High School. She published her first book, The Literary Origins of Surrealism in 1947. In this groundbreaking study of the founders of modem French poetry, Anna Balakian placed avant-garde writers and artists against the background of French and German romanticism. In 1953 she began her long career at New York University culminating in her eight year chairmanship of the Department of Comparative Literature. Balakian's next book, Surrealism: The Road to the Absolute (1959), is a richly informed exposition of, and apologia for, surrealist literature and art.

He subsequently created the The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, Large Glass. The Large Glass pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp (who was soon to renounce artmaking for chess) became closely associated with the Dada movement that began in neutral Zrich, Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Francis Picabia (see above), Man Ray, Kurt Schwitters, Hannah Hch, Tristan Tzara, Hans Richter, Jean Arp, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several Dadaists are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.",CAR_d02084fe767aa4d6ea4b776db9d04e82dfef2a26,0," Escher's work is inescapably mathematical. This has caused a disconnect between his full-on popular fame and the lack of esteem with which he has been viewed in the art world. His originality and mastery of graphic techniques is respected, but his works have been thought too intellectual and insufficiently lyrical. Movements such as conceptual art have to a degree reversed the art world's attitude to intellectuality and lyricism, but this did not rehabilitate Escher because traditional critics still disliked his narrative themes and his use of perspective. However, these same qualities made his work highly attractive to the public. Escher is not the first artist to explore mathematical themes: Parmigianino (15031540) had explored spherical geometry and reflection in his 1524 Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror, depicting his own image in a curved mirror, while William Hogarth's 1754 Satire on False Perspective, foreshadows Escher's playful exploration of errors in perspective. Another early artistic forerunner is Giovanni Battista Piranesi (17201778), whose dark fantastical prints such as The Drawbridge in his Carceri (Prisons) sequence depict perspectives into complex architecture with many stairs and ramps, peopled by walking figures. Only with 20th century movements such as Cubism, De Stijl, Dadaism and Surrealism did mainstream art start to explore Escher-like ways of looking at the world with multiple simultaneous viewpoints. However, while Escher had much in common with, for example, Magritte's surrealism, he did not make contact with any of these movements.",CAR_d88ec27c828ad6286e790840ffdcb5de6dcc9750,0,,

Dreamtime is a kind of surreal time that exists outside of ordinary time; all times and no time at all simultaneously.  This kind of surrealism common to Oceania gained many admirers, notably Picasso and his peers in the Surrealist movement.

It emphasized speed, technology, youth, and violence, and objects such as the car, the aeroplane, and the industrial city. Although it was largely an Italian phenomenon, there were parallel movements in Russia, England, Belgium and elsewhere. The Futurists practiced in every medium of art including painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, urban design, theatre, film, fashion, textiles, literature, music, architecture, and even gastronomy. Its key figures were the Italians Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carr, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, Antonio Sant'Elia, Bruno Munari, Benedetta Cappa and Luigi Russolo, the Russians Natalia Goncharova, Velimir Khlebnikov, Igor Severyanin, David Burliuk, Aleksei Kruchenykh and Vladimir Mayakovsky, the Belgian Jules Schmalzigaug and the Portuguese Almada Negreiros. It glorified modernity and aimed to liberate Italy from the weight of its past. Cubism contributed to the formation of Italian Futurism's artistic style. Important Futurist works included Marinetti's Manifesto of Futurism, Boccioni's sculpture Unique Forms of Continuity in Space, and Balla's painting Abstract Speed + Sound (pictured).

The group was heavily influenced by the preceding avant-garde movements of Dadaism and Surrealism, seeking to apply critical theories based on these concepts to all areas of art and culture, most notably in poetry, film, painting and political theory. Among some of the concepts and artistic innovations developed by the Lettrists were the lettrie, a poem reflecting pure form yet devoid of all semantic content, new syntheses of writing and visual art identified as metagraphics and hypergraphics, as well as new creative techniques in filmmaking. Future situationist Guy Debord, who was at that time a significant figure in the Lettrist movement, helped develop these new film techniques, using them in his Lettrist film Howls for Sade (1952) as well as later in his situationist film Society of the Spectacle (1972).",CAR_e853eea1a71f70fbee4ed6fafce3f3ff63a0ae8b,0," Works were included in three influential exhibitions held 'to promote the public awareness of art therapy' between 1955 and 1968.

The manifestos represent the Futurists statement of artistic purpose and defined the creative work of its founders and later followers. Balla, among other artists, signed his name at the bottom of the latter manifesto and would later go on to publish his own renditions of the Futurist mission. The Futurists lived in a time of fierce social and political change. The industrial world was unfolding as technology continued to advance. They were quite avant-garde and used materials indicative of a modern age, as exemplified in Boccionis bronze Unique Forms of Continuity in Space. The Italian dictionary defines futurism as  wanting to make a clean slate of the past and traditional forms of expression to make way for the inquisition of dynamic modern life, a mechanical civilization projecting into the future in a riot of senses. The movement is all about literal and figurative movement on both individual and larger, national scales. Physical movement often is used in Futurist art to represent machinery, which in turn represents technology and ultimately our progress and movement as a civilization into the future. The Futurists were a very extreme bunch; not one of them was over the age of thirty and they considered war the worlds own hygiene. They opposed ideas of morality and feminism, and saw great promise in speed. Their world was hurtling into the future, and there was time only to depict only the truly beautiful. In 1909, they wrote, Beauty exists only in struggle. There is no masterpiece that has not an aggressive character.

The Large Glass pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp became closely associated with the Dada movement that began in neutral Zurich, Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works.

Joan Mir's The Tilled Field of 19231924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Mir's first Surrealist masterpiece. Mir's The Tilled Field also contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work that Mir saw as a young painter in The Prado. The more abstract Joan Mir, Jean Arp, Andr Masson, and Max Ernst were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A Surrealist group developed in Britain and, according to Breton, their 1936 London International Surrealist Exhibition was a high water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions.

In line with the Surrealist movement's objectives, Dal stated that his artistic aim was that ...the world of imagination and of concrete irrationality may be as objectively evident ... as that of the exterior world..., and this goal can be seen in his most familiar painting, The Persistence of Memory. Here he paints with a precise, realistic style, based on studies of Dutch and Spanish masters, but with a subject that dissolves the boundaries between organic and mechanical and is more akin to the nightmarish scenes of the Netherlandish painter Hieronymus Bosch, whose Garden of Earthly Delights provided the model for the central, sleeping figure of Dal's work.",CAR_381f1905e11bf863c520229566c9c7539c046a2a,0," Surrealism is often classified as a form of Modern Art.

During this time, Gogol's works were primarily focused on surrealism and the grotesque, with a romantic twist. Written between 1835 and 1836, The Nose tells the story of a St. Petersburg official whose nose leaves his face and develops a life of its own. The Nose was originally published in The Contemporary, a literary journal owned by Alexander Pushkin. The use of a nose as the main source of conflict in the story could have been due to Gogol's own experience with an oddly shaped nose, which was often the subject of self-deprecating jokes in letters.

SysRq was used in earlier computers as a panic button to recover from crashes (and it is still used in this sense to some extent by the Linux kernel; see Magic SysRq key). The Print screen command used to capture the entire screen and send it to the printer, but in the present it usually puts a screenshot in the clipboard. The Break keyPause key no longer has a well-defined purpose. Its origins go back to teleprinter users, who wanted a key that would temporarily interrupt the communications line. The Break key can be used by software in several different ways, such as to switch between multiple login sessions, to terminate a program, or to interrupt a modem connection.In programming, especially old DOS-style BASIC, Pascal and C, Break is used (in conjunction with Ctrl) to stop program execution. In addition to this, Linux and variants, as well as many DOS programs, treat this combination the same as Ctrl+C. On modern keyboards, the break key is usually labeled PauseBreak. In most Windows environments, the key combination Windows key+Pause brings up the system properties.The Escape key (often abbreviated Esc) is used to initiate an escape sequence. As most computer users no longer are concerned with the details of controlling their computer's peripherals, the task for which the escape sequences were originally designed, the escape key was appropriated by application programmers, most often to escape or back out of a mistaken command. This use continues today in Microsoft Windows's use of escape as a shortcut in dialog boxes for No, Quit, Exit, Cancel, or Abort.A common application today of the Esc key is as a shortcut key for the Stop button in many web browsers. On machines running Microsoft Windows, prior to the implementation of the Windows key on keyboards, the typical practice for invoking the start button was to hold down the control key and press escape. This process still works in Windows 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10.The Enter key is located: One in the alphanumeric keys and the other one is in the numeric keys.

When one typed and finished typing a paragraph and they wanted to have a second paragraph, they could press enter and it would do spacing.Shift key: when one presses shift and a letter, it will capitalize the letter pressed with the shift key. Another use is to type more symbols than appear to be available, for instance the apostrophe key is accompanied with a quotation mark on the top. If one wants to type the quotation mark but pressed that key alone, the symbol that would appear would be the apostrophe. The quotation mark will only appear if both the required key and the Shift key are pressed.The Menu key or Application key is a key found on Windows-oriented computer keyboards. It is used to launch a context menu with the keyboard rather than with the usual right mouse button. The key's symbol is usually a small icon depicting a cursor hovering above a menu. On some Samsung keyboards the cursor in the icon is not present, showing the menu only.  This key was created at the same time as the Windows key. This key is normally used when the right mouse button is not present on the mouse.

These engravers often worked 12- to 16-hour days and each line was scratched by hand onto soft steel plate with a magnifying glass in one hand. One mistake could ruin an entire plate. There were a half dozen engravers in England that made this look easy, based on the volume of etchings produced. A few of these popular engravers were admitted to the Royal Academy, including William Henry Mote.

This brought about a revival of the Taiwanese Nativist art movement, in which Wu was extremely influential. In 1964, Wu joined the Modern Print Society and began to produce woodblock prints. The artist temporarily abandoned oil painting, as he believed that woodblock printing was a more successful method for capturing the Orients qualities, characteristics and identity.  The movement is thought to have emerged in 1949, and was typified by a deliberate rejection of Western art techniques that were initially introduced to Taiwan by the Japanese throughout their colonial rule. Furthermore, the movement aimed to portray indigenous Taiwanese cultural forms and their relationship to the Taiwanese social, economic, cultural and political identity.   Wu employed Nativism in his artwork to exert and explore national Taiwanese characteristics, particularly throughout the 1960s and 1970s when the movement was fruitfully revitalised.

The history of today's asemic movement stems from two Chinese calligraphers: crazy Zhang Xu, a Tang Dynasty (circa 800 CE) calligrapher who was famous for creating wild illegible calligraphy, and the younger drunk monk Huaisu who also excelled at illegible cursive calligraphy. In the 1920s Henri Michaux, who was influenced by Asian calligraphy and Surrealism, began to create wordless works such as Alphabet (1925) and Narration (1927). Michaux referred to his calligraphic works as interior Gestures. The writer and artist Wassily Kandinsky was an early precursor to asemic writing, with his linear piece Indian Story (1931) exemplifying complete textual abstraction. In the 1950s there is Brion Gysin, Isidore Isou, Cy Twombly, and Morita ShiryuBokujin-Kai Group all of whom expanded writing into illegible and wordless visual mark-making; they would help lay the foundation for asemic writers of the future. Mirtha Dermisache is another writer who had created asemic writing since the 1960s. Dermisache actively said that even though her graphisms have no meaning, they still retained the full rights of an autonomous work. 1971 was the year when Alain Sati released his work crit en prose ou L'uvre hypergraphique which contains asemic writing throughout the entire graphic novel. Len Ferrari was another artistpoet who created many asemic works in the 1960s and 70s, such as Escritura (1976). A modern example of asemic writing is Luigi Serafini's Codex Seraphinianus. Serafini described the script of the Codex as asemic in a talk at the Oxford University Society of Bibliophiles held on May 8, 2009. Roland Barthes was also involved with asemic writing; he titled his asemic works Contre-critures. 1974 saw the release of Max Ernst's work Maximiliana: The Illegal Practice Of Astronomy: hommage  Dorothea Tanning; this book is a major influence on asemic writers such as Tim Gaze, Michael Jacobson, and Derek Beaulieu. In the 1980s Chinese artist Xu Bing created Tinsh, or A Book from the Sky which is a work of books and hanging scrolls on which were printed 4000 hand carved meaningless characters. The 1980s also saw artist Gu Wenda begin the first of a series of projects centered on the invention of meaningless, false Chinese ideograms, depicted as if they were truly old and traditional.

Her eccentric, accentuated realism drew attention from galleries, established artists and collectors, which immediately propelled Earley to the forefront of a burgeoning art movement.

This has caused a disconnect between his full-on popular fame and the lack of esteem with which he has been viewed in the art world. His originality and mastery of graphic techniques is respected, but his works have been thought too intellectual and insufficiently lyrical. Movements such as conceptual art have to a degree reversed the art world's attitude to intellectuality and lyricism, but this did not rehabilitate Escher because traditional critics still disliked his narrative themes and his use of perspective. However, these same qualities made his work highly attractive to the public. Escher is not the first artist to explore mathematical themes: Parmigianino (15031540) had explored spherical geometry and reflection in his 1524 Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror, depicting his own image in a curved mirror, while William Hogarth's 1754 Satire on False Perspective, foreshadows Escher's playful exploration of errors in perspective. Another early artistic forerunner is Giovanni Battista Piranesi (17201778), whose dark fantastical prints such as The Drawbridge in his Carceri (Prisons) sequence depict perspectives into complex architecture with many stairs and ramps, peopled by walking figures. Only with 20th century movements such as Cubism, De Stijl, Dadaism and Surrealism did mainstream art start to explore Escher-like ways of looking at the world with multiple simultaneous viewpoints.

Although it was largely an Italian phenomenon, there were parallel movements in Russia, England, Belgium and elsewhere. The Futurists practiced in every medium of art including painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, urban design, theatre, film, fashion, textiles, literature, music, architecture, and even gastronomy. Its key figures were the Italians Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carr, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, Antonio Sant'Elia, Bruno Munari, Benedetta Cappa and Luigi Russolo, the Russians Natalia Goncharova, Velimir Khlebnikov, Igor Severyanin, David Burliuk, Aleksei Kruchenykh and Vladimir Mayakovsky, the Belgian Jules Schmalzigaug and the Portuguese Almada Negreiros. It glorified modernity and aimed to liberate Italy from the weight of its past. Cubism contributed to the formation of Italian Futurism's artistic style. Important Futurist works included Marinetti's Manifesto of Futurism, Boccioni's sculpture Unique Forms of Continuity in Space, and Balla's painting Abstract Speed + Sound (pictured). To some extent Futurism influenced the art movements Art Deco, Constructivism, Surrealism, Dada, and to a greater degree Precisionism, Rayonism, and Vorticism.",CAR_e32722468e4e86b12b7d4dfd77f3effba55caa6b,0," Their work was known for grotesquerie, surrealism and complete uninvolvement with New York art world trends.

John Drinkwater was one of the originators of the Georgian Poetry movement in 1912, and one of only five poets whose work was to feature in all of the Georgian Poetry anthologies. Later editions of the series also included the work of the Halesowen-born, Birmingham-educated writer Francis Brett Young. Charles Madge, later the founder of Mass-Observation and Professor of Sociology at Birmingham University, was a leading Surrealist poet during the 1930s. His poetry featured regularly in the London Bulletin, and his 1933 article Surrealism for the English advocated that English surrealist poets would need to combine knowledge of the philosophical position of the French surrealists with a knowledge of their own language and literature two or three years before most people in England had even heard of the movement. Henry Treece, who was born in Wednesbury and educated at the University of Birmingham, led the neo-romantic reaction against Auden Group in the late 1930s and 1940s as one of the founders of the New Apocalyptics, describing the movement in his 1946 work How I See Apocalypse: In my definition, the writer who senses the chaos, the turbulence, the laughter and the tears, the order and the peace of the world in its entirety, is an Apocalyptic writer.

Although fascinated by dream-like states of the nomadic unconscious and other imaginary worlds of the marvelous, a dispute with Breton in 1929 got him expelled from the movement, and prompted him to contribute to Un Cadavre, an anti-Breton pamphlet. After the break with Surrealism, Baron became associated with Georges Bataille and Documents, in which he published a short essay on  Crustaceans for the Critical Dictionary (1929, issue 6), an article on the sculptor Jacques Lipchitz (1930, issue 1), and a poem dedicated to Picasso,  Flames (1930, issue 3).

Through her art Pozniak often explores what it is to be a woman in todays world with recurring themes of women's rights, social justice and women's history. Her artworks combine the choreographic traditions of theater with symbolic and surreal imagery of painting and sculpture. In her early mask series, Pozniak connects an ancient and mythological theatrical device with the surrealism of Man Ray to produce a stunning range of fantastical masks made from feathers and other found objects.  Her more recent paintings and sculptures explore the collision of ancient myths and the modern world. By combining imagery reminiscent of surrealist dreamscapes with found objects these works challenge our notions of continuity between past and present. Pozniak says:Surrealism is a lens through which I view many of the events and circumstances occurring in the world today. Whether it is the horrors of war or inspirational insights found in ancient mythology, I am constantly exploring fantastical juxtapositions that express something about the experience of being a woman. That is why my paintings and sculptures are often surreal and full of symbolism. Feministic, poetical, and political. ",CAR_14755091ddaa675421d71fe5d59318b695b6d876,0," What is gouache paint?

After Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase became the international cause celebre at the 1913 Armory show in New York he created the The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, Large Glass. The Large Glass pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp became closely associated with the Dada movement that began in neutral Zurich, Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Francis Picabia (see above), Man Ray, Kurt Schwitters, Tristan Tzara, Hans Richter, Jean Arp, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several Dadaists are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.In 1924 Andr Breton published the Surrealist Manifesto. The Surrealist movement in painting became synonymous with the avant-garde and which featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like Machine Turn Quickly, (above) Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the Dada movement through 1919 in Zurich and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in Surrealist art. Yves Tanguy, Ren Magritte and Salvador Dal are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. Joan Mir's The Tilled Field of 19231924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Mir's first Surrealist masterpiece. Mir's The Tilled Field also contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work that Mir saw as a young painter in The Prado. The more abstract Joan Mir, Jean Arp, Andr Masson, and Max Ernst were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large.

As a teenager, he worked at an art supply store owned by his parents, Blanka and Sandor. After the deportation of Hungarian Jews began in MarchApril 1944, 14-year-old Zeev Kun was first sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, then to Jaworzno concentration camp, located 23 kilometers away from Auschwitz and used as its outer branch, and from January to April 1945 he was imprisoned at the camps of Gross-Rosen, Buchenwald and Flossenbrg; on April 23, 1945, the prisoners of the camp Flossenbrg were freed by American troops. In late August 1945, Zeev Kun came back to Hungary, and with the Auschwitz concentration camp tattoo still visible on his arm, he resumed school. Later, he entered the Magyar Kpzmvszeti Fiskola in Budapest (nowadays called Hungarian University of Fine Arts) in the fall of 1947, where he studied for over a year and a half. In 1949, as the new pro-communist political regime was growing more and more repressive, Zeev Kun joined a group of thirty Jews from the leftist Zionist organization Hashomer Hatzair and managed to secretly cross the Czech border, and later he arrived to Italy via Austria. In the city of Bari, the group boarded a ship that brought them to Israel. Once in Israel, Zeev Kun first settled at the kibbutz Givat-Haim near Hadera. He did not stay there for long, though, as in 1951 he became a student at the Akademie der bildenden Knste Wien Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, as the city had just witnessed the birth of the so-called Vienna School of Fantastic Realism. Students and young professors of the Academy sought to reflect upon the tragedy of World War II, still maintaining a dialog with the masters of German Renaissance (such as Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Bruegel the Elder), as well as the pioneers of surrealism of 1920s and 1930s, first of all Max Ernst (18911976). At the Academy, Zeev Kun was close to Anton Lehmden (born in 1929) and Ernst Fuchs (19302015). In his art, the latter focused on the images of Apocalypse, creating paintings shot through with dread and fear of death. It is no wonder that Zeev Kun, who himself survived the nightmare of Auschwitz and Buchenwald, was so overwhelmed by the works of Fuchs, who happened to be his peer.Upon his return to Israel, Zeev Kun joined the Israeli Painters and Sculptors Association.In 1973 he was awarded the prestigious Max Nordau Prize for Arts.

The history of today's asemic movement stems from two Chinese calligraphers: crazy Zhang Xu, a Tang Dynasty (circa 800 CE) calligrapher who was famous for creating wild illegible calligraphy, and the younger drunk monk Huaisu who also excelled at illegible cursive calligraphy. In the 1920s Henri Michaux, who was influenced by Asian calligraphy and Surrealism, began to create wordless works such as Alphabet (1925) and Narration (1927). Michaux referred to his calligraphic works as interior Gestures. The writer and artist Wassily Kandinsky was an early precursor to asemic writing, with his linear piece Indian Story (1931) exemplifying complete textual abstraction. In the 1950s there is Brion Gysin, Isidore Isou, Cy Twombly, and Morita ShiryuBokujin-Kai Group all of whom expanded writing into illegible and wordless visual mark-making; they would help lay the foundation for asemic writers of the future. Mirtha Dermisache is another writer who had created asemic writing since the 1960s. Dermisache actively said that even though her graphisms have no meaning, they still retained the full rights of an autonomous work. 1971 was the year when Alain Sati released his work crit en prose ou L'uvre hypergraphique which contains asemic writing throughout the entire graphic novel. Len Ferrari was another artistpoet who created many asemic works in the 1960s and 70s, such as Escritura (1976). A modern example of asemic writing is Luigi Serafini's Codex Seraphinianus. Serafini described the script of the Codex as asemic in a talk at the Oxford University Society of Bibliophiles held on May 8, 2009. Roland Barthes was also involved with asemic writing; he titled his asemic works Contre-critures. 1974 saw the release of Max Ernst's work Maximiliana: The Illegal Practice Of Astronomy: hommage  Dorothea Tanning; this book is a major influence on asemic writers such as Tim Gaze, Michael Jacobson, and Derek Beaulieu. In the 1980s Chinese artist Xu Bing created Tinsh, or A Book from the Sky which is a work of books and hanging scrolls on which were printed 4000 hand carved meaningless characters. The 1980s also saw artist Gu Wenda begin the first of a series of projects centered on the invention of meaningless, false Chinese ideograms, depicted as if they were truly old and traditional. One exhibition of this type was held in Xi'an in 1986, featuring paintings of fake ideograms on a massive scale.  Also in China, during the 1990s, an abstract calligraphy movement known as Calligraphy-ism came into existence, a leading proponent of this movement being Luo Qi. Calligraphy-ism is an aesthetic movement that aims todevelop calligraphy into an abstract art. The characters do not need to retain their traditional forms or be legible as words. In Vietnam during the 2000s a calligraphy group called the Zenei Gang of Five appeared.

He was also a writer whose novel Hebdomeros presents a series of dreamscapes with an unusual use of punctuation, syntax, and grammar designed to create an atmosphere and frame its images.

The artist never paints direct scenes of mass death. Instead, he employs allegory, metaphor and certain artistic devices such as substitution: toys instead of the murdered children who played with them, books, instead of the people who read them.  Further devices are quotations of iconographical prototyes, i.e. Michelangelo's Creation of Adam (151112) on the Sistine Ceiling or Albrecht Drer's famous engraving entitled Melencholia (1516). He turns these prototypes into ironical statements. Irony in the art of Samuel Bak does not mean parody or derision, but rather disenchantment, and the attempt to achieve distance from pain. Recurring symbols are: the Warsaw Ghetto Child, Crematorium Chimneys or vast backgrounds of Renaissance landscape that symbolize the indifference of the outside world. These form a disturbing contrast with the broken and damaged images in the foreground.

The first problem scholars ran into was defining success for social movements. Scholars and activists often have disagreements of what a movement's goals are, and thus come to different conclusions about whether a movement has succeeded. Many times there are positive impacts, but they are not what were anticipated by anyone. For this reason scholars have tended to use the Collective Goods Criterion (see below) after Gamson originally published his work and garnered criticism.",CAR_ad07e682f3c9b4d7d671b208d840cbe1bb2f0c96,0," In his 2006 book Surrealism and Cinema, Michael Richardson argues that surrealist works cannot be defined by style or form, but rather as results of the practice of surrealism. Richardson writes: Within popular conceptions, surrealism is misunderstood in many different ways, some of which contradict others, but all of these misunderstandings are founded in the fact that they seek to reduce surrealism to a style or a thing in itself rather than being prepared to see it as an activity with broadening horizons. Many critics fail to recognize the distinctive qualities that make up the surrealist attitude. They seek something  a theme, a particular type of imagery, certain concepts  they can identify as 'surrealist' in order to provide a criterion of judgement by which a film or artwork can be appraised. The problem is that this goes against the very essence of surrealism, which refuses to be here but is always elsewhere. It is not a thing but a relation between things and therefore needs to be treated as a whole. Surrealists are not concerned with conjuring up some magic world that can be defined as 'surreal'. Their interest is almost exclusively in exploring the conjunctions, the points of contact, between different realms of existence. Surrealism is always about departures rather than arrivals. Rather than a fixed aesthetic, Richardson defines surrealism as a shifting point of magnetism around which the collective activity of the surrealists revolves.",CAR_ad6462b685238c405ae455aa3ddf228c52c9bf9c,0," Most of the river flows through the Garawarra State Conservation Park and the Royal National Park.

The surreals share many properties with the reals, including the usual arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division); as such, they form an ordered field.

Some would argue that this continuous re-evaluation is also just a component of the design process - happening for most of the second half of the 20th century in the profession.Since it was ultimately the work of graphic designers that inspired pop artists like Warhol and Liechtenstein, and architects like Robert Venturi and Denise Scott-Brown, it could be argued that graphic design practice and designs may be the root of Postmodernism.",CAR_b163731cd7c7944d0976fffd226e0b1d1d33ed0c,0," The impact factor (IF) of an academic journal is a measure reflecting the yearly average number of citations to recent articles published in that journal.

As an example, cobaltcopper nanowires are obtained from an electrolyte containing both metals. At low voltage, pure copper is deposited while cobalt resists electro-deposition. At high voltage, both metals are deposited as an alloy. If the electrolyte contains predominantly cobalt, a magnetic cobalt-copper alloy is deposited with a high fraction of cobalt. The electrical conductivity of the multilayer wire depends on the applied external magnetic field. The magnetic order of the cobalt layers increases with the applied field. Without magnetic field, neighboring magnetic layers prefer the anti-parallel order. With magnetic field, the magnetic layers prefer the orientation parallel with the magnetic field. The parallel orientation corresponds to a reduced electrical resistance.

This has caused a disconnect between his full-on popular fame and the lack of esteem with which he has been viewed in the art world. His originality and mastery of graphic techniques is respected, but his works have been thought too intellectual and insufficiently lyrical. Movements such as conceptual art have to a degree reversed the art world's attitude to intellectuality and lyricism, but this did not rehabilitate Escher because traditional critics still disliked his narrative themes and his use of perspective. However, these same qualities made his work highly attractive to the public. Escher is not the first artist to explore mathematical themes: Parmigianino (15031540) had explored spherical geometry and reflection in his 1524 Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror, depicting his own image in a curved mirror, while William Hogarth's 1754 Satire on False Perspective, foreshadows Escher's playful exploration of errors in perspective. Another early artistic forerunner is Giovanni Battista Piranesi (17201778), whose dark fantastical prints such as The Drawbridge in his Carceri (Prisons) sequence depict perspectives into complex architecture with many stairs and ramps, peopled by walking figures. Only with 20th century movements such as Cubism, De Stijl, Dadaism and Surrealism did mainstream art start to explore Escher-like ways of looking at the world with multiple simultaneous viewpoints.

Giorgio de Chirico moved to Paris in July 1911, where he joined his brother Andrea (the poet and painter known as Alberto Savinio). Through his brother he met Pierre Laprade, a member of the jury at the Salon d'Automne, where he exhibited three of his dreamlike works: Enigma of the Oracle, Enigma of an Afternoon and Self-Portrait. During 1913 he exhibited his work at the Salon des Indpendants and Salon dAutomne, where his work was noticed by Pablo Picasso, Guillaume Apollinaire, and others. His compelling and mysterious paintings are considered instrumental to the early beginnings of Surrealism. Song of Love (1914) is one of the most famous works by de Chirico and is an early example of the surrealist style, though it was painted ten years before the movement was founded by Andr Breton in 1924 (see gallery).",CAR_de741b614a839fcb2ef34feba35a723c7d8c69d3,0," According to Cernat, his articles for Integral show Fondane as an ally of the anti-political and lyrical side of Surrealism, a poet placing his trust in the negative-soteriological, liberating function of poetry. The impact of existentialist philosophy was even traced to the cine-poems by Martin Stanton (who called the pieces amazing). In contrast to the Surrealists, Fondane did not believe in a need to circulate poems as universal messages, but rather saw them as the basis for a very personal relationship with the reader: This is not a time for print. Poetry is seeking its friends, not an audience. ... Poetry will be for the fewor it will not be at all. Chitrit, who parallels Fondane's definitions with the similar views of Romanian poet and Holocaust survivor Paul Celan, concludes: This is probably the closest that we can come to seeing contemporary poetry. Fondane's other literary works also evidence the impact of his philosophical preoccupations. With Le Fstin de Balthazar, the writer modified his earlier Monologul by adopting Shestivist themes (introducing allegorical characters who discuss Aristotelianism, capitalism and revolution) and by introducing some elements from the burlesque. Originally conceived in 1918 and completed in 1933, Philoctte reworked Sophocles' play of the same title, interpreting it through the style of Gide's dramas.",CAR_de7f3dd74a2c927be4ecc13d578bbc9b6d5ae459,0," Although Roh originally meant the term 'Magic Realism' to be more or less synonymous with Neue Sachlichkeit, the artists identified by Hartlaub as 'classicists' later became associated with Roh's term. These 'Magic Realists' were all influenced by the classicism developed in Italy by the Novecento, and in turn by de Chirico's concept of metaphysical art, which had also branched into surrealism. Art critic Wieland Schmeid in 1977 posited that despite the fact that the terms were meant to refer to the same thing, the understanding of them as different groups derives from the fact that the movement had a right and left wing, with the Magic Realists on the right  many later supporting fascism or accommodating to it and the verists we associate as the Neue Sachlichkeit on the left  fighting against fascism.

Surrealism took an interest in automatism and the unconscious, just like Spare's work, and although he did not think highly of the surrealists, he was often described at the time as a British forerunner of the surrealist movement; indeed, the reporter Hubert Nicholson ran a story on him titled Father of Surrealism  He's a Cockney!. Jumping onto this new craze for surrealism, Spare released a set of what he described as SURREALIST Racing Forecast Cards for use in divination.

In general, the minimum length of guardrail with an end anchor at the trailing end and an end terminal on the approach end will be 62.5 to 75 feet in length.  An example would be where an overhead roadside sign structure is placed within what is considered the clear recovery zone, and an engineer determines that the structure has a potential to be impacted and the impact of a vehicle withthat structure would be much more severe than impacting the guardrail that was placed to contain and redirect a vehicle away from that structure, knowing that the potential to impact the guardrail will be much higher than that of the sign structure.  Guardrail has frequently ranked amongst the highest sources of injury and fatality collisions with a fixed-object crash. Among the primary reasons for this is the type of treatment used at the end of the guardrail facing oncoming traffic.  Most end terminal designs will either gate and allow a vehicle to pass through the system within the first 12.5 feet or redirect a vehicle if impacted beyond the first 12.5 feet.  Some end terminals also have energy absorbing properties when impacted in the head on position, and will actually slow a vehicle upon impact by absorbing the vehicles kinetic energy and dispersing it through the rail.  This is typically accomplished by forcing rail elements through an extrusion impact head that has smaller dimensions that the rail being forced through it.  The force rate and flattening of the rail through the head absorbs kinetic energy dissipating it through the extrusion head and slowing the vehicle.  These types of systems have demonstrated that an errant vehicle, impacting a system in the head on position, can be effectively stopped in a distance of 50 feet or less.  As compared to non-energy absorbing end terminals which can allow a vehicle to pass through the system and travel in excess of 250 feet behind and beyond the system.",CAR_f4453f0dc60ea88774b0832b5a11043a2efe1d5f,0," Dau al Set  was heavily influenced by two movements before its creation, those two being Dadaism and Surrealism.  Dadaism was a Europen art movement in the early 20th century which focused on the avant-garde. This style was meant to fight against the bourgeois in society with the belief that their reason and logic were the cause of war. With an anti-reason and anti-logic sentiment most of the works of art often contained elements of chaos and irrationality. Dadaist art also utilized the following techniques of cubism, collages, cut-up technique, photomontages, and assemblage which can be seen in Dau al Set's work. From this movement spawned the pre-war avant-garde which was the community Dau al Set were trying to revive. Some influential artists on Dau al Set from this movement are Francis Picabia and Max Ernst.",CAR_f7211e38b91d386a35170be4b3098a580220bd8f,0," Technically, an important predecessor is surrealism, with its emphasis on spontaneous, automatic, or subconscious creation. Jackson Pollock's dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of Andr Masson, Max Ernst, and David Alfaro Siqueiros. The newer research tends to put the exile-surrealist Wolfgang Paalen in the position of the artist and theoretician who fostered the theory of the viewer-dependent possibility space through his paintings and his magazine DYN. Paalen considered ideas of quantum mechanics, as well as idiosyncratic interpretations of the totemic vision and the spatial structure of native-Indian painting from British Columbia and prepared the ground for the new spatial vision of the young American abstracts. His long essay Totem Art (1943) had considerable influence on such artists as Martha Graham, Isamu Noguchi, Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman. Around 1944 Barnett Newman tried to explain America's newest art movement and included a list of the men in the new movement. Paalen is mentioned twice, other artists mentioned are Gottlieb, Rothko, Pollock, Hofmann, Baziotes, Gorky and others. Motherwell is mentioned with a question mark. Another important early manifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist Mark Tobey, especially his white writing canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the all-over look of Pollock's drip paintings.",CAR_f855d94d61a7e4c40140cd8bcbb626cfe4a5387b,0," Afro-Surrealism came about after the initial rise in surrealism in the mid-1920s, after Andr Breton wrote the Surrealist Manifesto. Similar to the mainstream version of surrealism, Afro-Surrealism was not a single movement or style. Rather, it incorporated aspects of the Harlem Renaissance, Ngritude and magical realism. Aspects of Afro-Surrealism can be traced to Martiniquan Suzanne Csaires discussion of the revolutionary impetus of surrealism in the 1940s.",CAR_f966194ecac71b5b8e6162e830448945d683579c,0," OTV has not only been influenced by other music, but by artistic and literary movements including Constructivism, Hermeticism, Bauhaus, Surrealism, the Beat generation, Cut-up, Pop Art, as well as the occult and secret societies, reflecting upon the great interest in architecture, painting and literature of band members.

Their jargon notwithstanding, Contimporanul still published the work of authors who urged respect for Symbolism (most notably, the journalist Horia Verzeanu). Despite the successive avant-garde episodes, Vinea himself preserved a traceable link to Symbolism, which resurfaced in his works of poems and prose until the final years in his life (according to one interpretation, the link with Symbolism was even preserved by Tzara himself, despite his international profile in Dada and Surrealism). Moving between Fondane's version of bucolic literature and a similar commitment to Surrealism, the younger Jewish poet Ilarie Voronca maintained links with Symbolist poetics throughout his career. Contimporanul itself remained open to the contribution of other Symbolists throughout its existence, and, as a consequence, alienated the new avant-garde trend of the early 1930s. In particular, the refusal of severing links with the Symbolist past and their overall eclecticism, made both Vinea and Voronca the targets of ridicule from the more radical Surrealist faction around unu review. However, the latter environment also kept a traceable link to Symbolist aesthetics, particularly the literary wing of Secession art, through the fiction and translations of H.

Minimalist photography encompasses common elements of sculpture and painting of the same style.  Later on the Portuguese artistic scene, names like Paula Rego and Jorge Martins begin to make an impact. Although with apparently different styles, they both manage to disturb and interact directly with the viewer through their paintings. Paula Rego, even though not being the most international Portuguese artist, she is the most internationally known painter. Many of her works belong to private collections like the Berardo Collection, an immensely important and valuable modern Portuguese contemporary art collection (evaluated by Christies in 316 million dollars), which also has valuable paintings by Jorge Martins.

After Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase became the international cause celebre at the 1913 Armory show in New York he created the The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, Large Glass. The Large Glass pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp became closely associated with the Dada movement that began in neutral Zurich, Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Francis Picabia (see above), Man Ray, Kurt Schwitters, Tristan Tzara, Hans Richter, Jean Arp, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several Dadaists are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.In 1924 Andr Breton published the Surrealist Manifesto. The Surrealist movement in painting became synonymous with the avant-garde and which featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like Machine Turn Quickly, (above) Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the Dada movement through 1919 in Zurich and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in Surrealist art. Yves Tanguy, Ren Magritte and Salvador Dal are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. Joan Mir's The Tilled Field of 19231924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Mir's first Surrealist masterpiece. Mir's The Tilled Field also contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work that Mir saw as a young painter in The Prado. The more abstract Joan Mir, Jean Arp, Andr Masson, and Max Ernst were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large.

This exhibition toured the United States, and was followed by a series of influential exhibitions at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. Kelly L'Ecuyer suggests that Calder's jewelry was central to many of the museum and gallery exhibitions of this period, and he continues to be viewed as the seminal figure in American contemporary jewelry. Using cold construction and crude techniques that suggested a spirit of improvisation and creativity, Calder's jewelry shares his sculpture's use of line and movement to describe space, creating jewelry that often moves with the wearer's body. A strong connection with art movements is a characteristic of American art jewelry during this period.

Surrealism as a political force developed unevenly around the world, in some places more emphasis being put on artistic practices, while in others political practises outweighed. In other places still, Surrealist praxis looked to overshadow both the arts and politics. Politically, Surrealism was ultra-leftist, communist, or anarchist. The split from Dada has been characterised as a split between anarchists and communists, with the Surrealists as communist. In 1925, the Bureau of Surrealist Research declared their affinity for revolutionary politics. By the 1930s many Surrealists had strongly identified themselves with communism.

States where revolutions are more likely to develop also are indiscriminate and violent towards mobilized oppositional groups and figures. States that have weak policing capacities and infrastructural power are also more likely to produce revolutions.

In Croatia, nave art was at first connected with the works of peasants and working men, ordinary men and women, of whom the most successful, over the course of time, became professional artists. Nave art assumes the work of artists who are more or less self-taught, painters and sculptors with no formal art training, but who have achieved their own creative style and a high level of art. An identifiably individual style and poetic nature distinguishes the Nave from other amateur painters and sculptors, and from the general self-taught artist. The view of a Nave artist will usually display unusual proportions and perspective, and certain illogicalities of form and space. Such characteristics are the expression of a free creative imagination, in a similar way to other 20th-century art movements such as Symbolism, Expressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism.",CAR_55ca7d85b7a3a798115445c01daf9b7dc9396ff8,0," According to some interpretations, similar to the brief inter-war political positioning of Andr Breton's surrealism, the Romanian branch had grown politicized in the 1940s, and recovered proletkult themes: Luca was referencing dialectical materialism, claiming that surrealism offered a perfect recipe against right-wing deviations. In their 1945 essay, Dialectique de la dialectique (Dialectic of Dialectics) (Bucharest, S Surralisme series), Trost and Luca decried the imperialist war, criticized Breton for failing to keep up with the progress of Hegelian and Marxist dialectics, and demanded a theoretical reexamination of surrealism. Naum, Teodorescu, and Pun's manifesto of the same year, Critica mizeriei (The Critique of Misery) (Bucharest, Surrealist Collection), which in a footnote criticized Luca for mysticism, has also been considered inspired by proletkult. However, according to a different perspective, the group by and large, while holding on to a leftist orientation, had in fact by then moved away from a Marxist view of social change and direct political involvement, working instead toward a revolution from within. This is evidenced by their collective 1946 text (Infra-noir: Prliminaires...), analyzed in this light by Eburne in Yaari, ed., under a motto taken from Pun's 1947 La Conspiration du silence: The Revolution is ungraspable. According to Yaari, this second view applies to Pun as well, who, in the somewhat hermetic style that had become characteristic of the group, wrote, also in 1947, in Les Esprits animaux: only the systematic blinding toward the partial lights of the has-been, of political and theoretical dj-vus, will provide us with the (magic) practical freedom of influencing the future with our movements. It is the dialectics of despair, its miracle, that sets now automatic action against the conspiracy of asphyxiation ....

Richardson writes: Within popular conceptions, surrealism is misunderstood in many different ways, some of which contradict others, but all of these misunderstandings are founded in the fact that they seek to reduce surrealism to a style or a thing in itself rather than being prepared to see it as an activity with broadening horizons. Many critics fail to recognize the distinctive qualities that make up the surrealist attitude. They seek something  a theme, a particular type of imagery, certain concepts  they can identify as 'surrealist' in order to provide a criterion of judgement by which a film or artwork can be appraised. The problem is that this goes against the very essence of surrealism, which refuses to be here but is always elsewhere. It is not a thing but a relation between things and therefore needs to be treated as a whole. Surrealists are not concerned with conjuring up some magic world that can be defined as 'surreal'. Their interest is almost exclusively in exploring the conjunctions, the points of contact, between different realms of existence. Surrealism is always about departures rather than arrivals.

Many important artists fled to North America, and relative safety in the United States. The art community in New York City in particular was already grappling with Surrealist ideas and several artists like Arshile Gorky, Jackson Pollock, and Robert Motherwell converged closely with the surrealist artists themselves, albeit with some suspicion and reservations. Ideas concerning the unconscious and dream imagery were quickly embraced. By the Second World War, the taste of the American avant-garde in New York City swung decisively towards Abstract Expressionism with the support of key taste makers, including Peggy Guggenheim, Leo Steinberg and Clement Greenberg. However, it should not be easily forgotten that Abstract Expressionism itself grew directly out of the meeting of American (particularly New York) artists with European Surrealists self-exiled during World War II. In particular, Gorky and Paalen influenced the development of this American art form, which, as Surrealism did, celebrated the instantaneous human act as the well-spring of creativity. The early work of many Abstract Expressionists reveals a tight bond between the more superficial aspects of both movements, and the emergence (at a later date) of aspects of Dadaistic humor in such artists as Rauschenberg sheds an even starker light upon the connection. Up until the emergence of Pop Art, Surrealism can be seen to have been the single most important influence on the sudden growth in American arts, and even in Pop, some of the humor manifested in Surrealism can be found, often turned to a cultural criticism.",CAR_b9b782041a95631ab74c8efffd510dda98e58697,0," Ossola uses acrylic and has a distinctive style that incorporates elements such as architecture, pools, clouds, rocks, shrubs, and obelisks in surreal landscapes.

Postmodern art is noted for the way in which it blurs the distinctions between what is perceived as fine or high art and what is generally seen as low or kitsch art. Whilst this concept of 'blurring' or 'fusing' high art with low art had been experimented during modernism, it only ever became fully endorsed after the advent of the postmodern era. Postmodernism introduced elements of commercialism, kitsch and a general camp aesthetic within its artistic context; postmodernism takes styles from past periods, such as Gothicism, the Renaissance and the Baroque, and mixes them so as to ignore their original use in their corresponding artistic movement.

Even in the many movies he made for hire (rather than for his own creative reasons), such as Susana and The Great Madcap, he usually added his trademark of disturbing and surreal images.  Some critics have pointed out that one reason why Buuel found working in Mexico so congenial was that what might seem unusual or even outlandish in Europe or the United States fit comfortably with elements of Mexican culture and the audience's expectations of national melodrama.  As filmmaker Toms Prez Turrent has commented, when referring to the apparently incredible features that many critics find in Buuel's films: In Mexico, it's believable, while one of the founders of Surrealism, Andr Breton, called Mexico, the most surrealist country in the world.   Certainly, running through the more personal films of Buuel's early and late years is a backbone of surrealism;  Buuel's world is one in which an entire dinner party suddenly finds itself inexplicably unable to leave the room and go home, a bad dream hands a man a letter which he brings to the doctor the next day, and where the devil, if unable to tempt a saint with a pretty girl, will fly him to a disco.

Surrealist artists in France became very interested in her once she began setting herself up as an artist, and came to know her as important in the movement. She is mentioned in most comprehensive works about surrealism, although some leave her out (interestingly enough she did not consider herself a surrealist). In 1949 Frederick Ashton choreographed a ballet conceptualized by Fini, Le Rve de Leonor (Leonor's Dream) with music by Benjamin Britten. In London, she exhibited at the Kaplan gallery in 1960 and at the Hanover Gallery in 1967.

A tribute to the many artistic and creative avenues that her career took throughout her lifetime, there were 100+ watercolors and drawings, around 80 theatrecostume designs, and about 70 paintings, 5 masks, etc.  Many of her paintings featured women in positions of power; an example of this is the painting  La Bout du Monde where a female figure is submerged in water up to her breasts with human and animal skulls surrounding her. Madonna used the imagery in her video, Bedtime Story in 2006.

After Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase became the international cause celebre at the 1913 Armory show in New York he created the The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, Large Glass. The Large Glass pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp became closely associated with the Dada movement that began in neutral Zurich, Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Francis Picabia (see above), Man Ray, Kurt Schwitters, Tristan Tzara, Hans Richter, Jean Arp, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several Dadaists are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.In 1924 Andr Breton published the Surrealist Manifesto. The Surrealist movement in painting became synonymous with the avant-garde and which featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like Machine Turn Quickly, (above) Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the Dada movement through 1919 in Zurich and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in Surrealist art. Yves Tanguy, Ren Magritte and Salvador Dal are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. Joan Mir's The Tilled Field of 19231924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Mir's first Surrealist masterpiece. Mir's The Tilled Field also contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work that Mir saw as a young painter in The Prado. The more abstract Joan Mir, Jean Arp, Andr Masson, and Max Ernst were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A Surrealist group developed in Britain and, according to Breton, their 1936 London International Surrealist Exhibition was a high water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions.

This exhibition toured the United States, and was followed by a series of influential exhibitions at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. Kelly L'Ecuyer suggests that Calder's jewelry was central to many of the museum and gallery exhibitions of this period, and he continues to be viewed as the seminal figure in American contemporary jewelry. Using cold construction and crude techniques that suggested a spirit of improvisation and creativity, Calder's jewelry shares his sculpture's use of line and movement to describe space, creating jewelry that often moves with the wearer's body. A strong connection with art movements is a characteristic of American art jewelry during this period. While Calder showed a primitivist interest in African and ancient Greek art, Margaret De Patta made jewelry that was constructivist, manipulating light, space and optical perception according to the lessons she learned from Lszl Moholy-Nagy at the New Bauhaus in Chicago. Toni Greenbaum writes that After his mentor, the painter John Haley, showed him work by Matisse and Picasso, Bob Winston exclaimed: 'That's the kind of crap I'm doing!'.

After extensive travels to Spain, the Orient and Latin America, his work gained a clear original profile (Hans M. Schmidt). Impulses from contemporary European Art can be traced to Joan Mir, Victor Vasarely, Giorgio Morandi or Domenico Gnoli, to Surrealism or OpArt. But the impulses are transformed and integrated into a unique concept that cannot be associated to any known current in Art.

Patrick Waldberg, the major biographer of surrealism, wrote of Klusemann's work that it is full of waving drapes, flying boxes, objects coming up in the air, swelling balloons, windows bursting open, instruments coming to life and all this according to a harmony beyond logic. Georg's biographer Hans M. Schmidt called him an individualist and a loner of unusual capacities.

He became a part of the avant-garde group Dau al Set in 1948 which was a group that had strong ties to Surrealism.  Early works of his were surrealistic, but in 1953 he began working in abstract art.  It is here that he becomes a part of the Art Informel movement and starts working with mixed media. Art Informel in Europe was the equivalent to Abstract Expressionism in America.  This was among the most prevalent styles of art in post-war Europe.  Within this movement is the category of Matter Painting.  Its focus on the use of odd objects completely undermines the acts of traditional fine art.  Some of Tpies's most famous and original works fall within this genre.  They are characterized by his use of marble dust and clay that he mixed with his paints as well as the incorporation of found objects such as string, paper, and cloth.  In the late 1960's into the early 1970's Tpies began to be influenced by the movement of Pop Art.  Because of this he began using larger items, such as pieces of furniture, in his works.",CAR_2f86f2d2587dedda30df60cc87b5cd0f03f84985,0," Walter Pashko studied painting in Hartford during the heyday of Chick Austin who made modern art, especially Surrealism, a great strength of the Wadsworth Atheneum.

Upon his return to America, he found a job at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston as an assistant to the printmaking instructor. Pashko was soon promoted to lead instructor when his supervisor retired. He remained at the School for over thirty years until a fall prompted him to retire in the early 1990s.

In another clip, Spears talks about how she uses her work as a dancer and singer to deal with the stress of her life and how it helps her deal with her emotions. She said that for her, dancing is like therapy. If I have a lot of nervous energy, when I start dancing, it all goes away and I just feel emotion. It's like a rollercoaster, she says. People think that when you go through something in life you have to go to therapy. For me, art is therapy, because it's like you're expressing yourself in such a spiritual way.

There are three main periods that can be highlighted in the history of multi - media performance; Futurism during the 1910s, mixed media performance during the 1960s and experimentation with a performance and the computer during the 1990s. Both during the eras of Futurism and the experimentation with computer incorporated within performance, they are both greatly inspired by the development of new and existing technology. Researching back, digital performance practices have experimented with numerous of the different avant  garde movements which can date right back from the early twentieth century, some of these movements can include the likes of Bauhaus, Dada, Surrealism and many more. It could be said that digital performance can be linked to the aesthetics, philosophies and practices of the futurist movement. One of the main links that has been found which can connect futurism to digital performance was with the use of the machine which was used in the set of Robert Lepages Zulu Time (1999). Although, it can be said that the avant  garde movement Futurism does have a more philosophical basis for contemporary digital performance, more so than any of the other avant  garde movements such as the likes of Bauhaus, Dada and Surrealism which are mainly used to provide inspiration for a large part of the content and styles for the artistic expression.

This was the basis for Concrete art and Surrealism which became the latest trend in the international Avant-garde movement. The association of Abstraction and Surrealism was pioneered by Vilhelm Bjerke-Petersen who in 1930 joined the Bauhaus School in Weimar, a key Avant-garde institution which revolutionized not just painting but architecture, sculpture, literature, theatre and dance. Bauhaus is remembered for its influence on Abstract art and Functionalist architecture and design. At the Bauhaus, Bjerke Petersen had studied under Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee and was thus familiar with contemporary theories of abstract art. This led to the publication in 1933 of Symboler i abstrakt kunst (Symbols in Abstract Art) which served as a manifesto for the movement in Denmark.",CAR_355d77842d4050553c2fa7e7cd694f927ff6926f,0," Many times the Indian police had raided his studio to search for someone who is backing him.

In writing and in the visual arts, and by using automatic writing, creative games (like the cadavre exquis) and altered states (through alcohol and narcotics), the surrealists tried to reveal the workings of the unconscious mind.

Reviewing the exhibition for ArtForum, Steven Henry Madoff wrote: The mutant sensibility at work in this droll, smartly curated exhibition proposes the marriage of Surrealism's dream-laden fetish for the body eroticized and grotesque and Pop art's celebration of the shallower, corrosively bright world given over the packaged good. The New York Times said of the exhibit at first, Surrealism and popular culture would seem to be oil and water. Surrealism mines dreams and the unconscious, while popular culture is concerned with surface and commonplaces.

The album is said to lean more heavily on influences including Philip Glass and Thomas Newman while still incorporating his singer-songwriter and rock roots. As Watts states, This approach to music has been growing in me for awhile. You can hear elements of it popping up on previous albums and especially on a few tracks from Life on Earth. I was profoundly effected by something Philip Glass said in his documentary (GLASS). I'm paraphrasing here, but he spoke about how poetry is about speaking, dance about movement and music about listening... and that he does't think about music, he listens to it and writes it down. This sparked something in me. It instantly felt true... that there was this current of music in me that I'm not always listening to in as pure a way as I could. So I sat down at the piano and began to just listen to what was there. Trying to avoid playing an instrument, I didn't want any habits to guide me, I just listened until there was music coming from inside of me and beyond technique. And rather than judge it or its validity, I trusted it and let myself go. I would compose the music this way as well as approach the lyrics similarly. What surprised me was the results were very new, yet felt truthful, or natural in a way I couldn't put my finger on... I guess it was just that it felt honest and it was sort of a given that I liked what I heard. I was preventing myself from getting into a headspace where I had a self-image associated with the music... it was more about expression. My approach to recording the album was an extension of this as well. I would write and record all in the same time frame. This isn't new for me, but my mindset was different, I was going for a moment and not letting the producer side of me take over too much. Rather than seek perfection in a technical sense, the new perfection became the truth of the moment more so. It's really transformed the way I approach my solo work. I noticed that this approach was closer to how I approached my visual arts as well... so there's this sense of it all coming together and coming from the same place... it just so happens that sometimes I'm creating for the ears and sometimes for the eyes, but it's all unified. This recent music and art feels as close to my core as anything I've done in the past... when I listen or look, there's this mirror like effect... like it's reflecting what it's like to be inside my skin. It's funny because with this kind of process, I don't find myself thinking much about whether people like it or not... I hope they do, but I realize people will either get it or they won't and it has nothing to do with me.

This brought about a revival of the Taiwanese Nativist art movement, in which Wu was extremely influential. In 1964, Wu joined the Modern Print Society and began to produce woodblock prints. The artist temporarily abandoned oil painting, as he believed that woodblock printing was a more successful method for capturing the Orients qualities, characteristics and identity.  The movement is thought to have emerged in 1949, and was typified by a deliberate rejection of Western art techniques that were initially introduced to Taiwan by the Japanese throughout their colonial rule. Furthermore, the movement aimed to portray indigenous Taiwanese cultural forms and their relationship to the Taiwanese social, economic, cultural and political identity.

Gallery owner Karl Nierendorf represented her until his death in 1947. During her time at Nierendorf, Nevelson came across a shoeshine box owned by local shoeshiner Joe Milone. She displayed the box at the Museum of Modern Art, bringing her the first major attention she received from the press. An article about her appeared in Art Digest in November 1943. In the 1940s, she began producing Cubist figure studies in materials such as stone, bronze, terra cotta, and wood. In 1943, she had a show at Norlyst Gallery called The Clown as the Center of his World in which she constructed sculptures about the circus from found objects. The show was not well received, and Nevelson stopped using found objects until the mid-1950s. Despite poor reception, Nevelson's works at this time explored both figurative abstracts inspired by Cubism and the exploitative and experimental influence of Surrealism. The decade provided Nevelson with the materials, movements, and self-created experiments that would mold her signature modernist style in the 1950s.",CAR_b10892b3c713d992d27cb17606d7797d8cd6a978,0," Lettrism is a French avant-garde movement, established in Paris in the mid-1940s by Romanian immigrant Isidore Isou. In a body of work totaling hundreds of volumes, Isou and the Lettrists have applied their theories to all areas of art and culture, most notably in poetry, film, painting and political theory. The movement has its theoretical roots in Dada and Surrealism. Isou viewed his fellow countryman, Tristan Tzara, as the greatest creator and rightful leader of the Dada movement, and dismissed most of the others as plagiarists and falsifiers. Among the Surrealists, Andr Breton was a significant influence, but Isou was dissatisfied by what he saw as the stagnation and theoretical bankruptcy of the movement as it stood in the 1940s.",CAR_059c6c3a3c9384f01893ae7363c57da86ce7aa70,0," Lyrical Abstraction in the late 1960s is characterized by the paintings of Dan Christensen,Ronnie Landfield, Peter Young and others,and along with the Fluxus movement and Postminimalism (a term first coined by Robert Pincus-Witten in the pages of Artforum in 1969)   sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and Minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression.

Many important artists fled to North America, and relative safety in the United States. The art community in New York City in particular was already grappling with Surrealist ideas and several artists like Arshile Gorky, Jackson Pollock, and Robert Motherwell converged closely with the surrealist artists themselves, albeit with some suspicion and reservations. Ideas concerning the unconscious and dream imagery were quickly embraced. By the Second World War, the taste of the American avant-garde in New York City swung decisively towards Abstract Expressionism with the support of key taste makers, including Peggy Guggenheim, Leo Steinberg and Clement Greenberg. However, it should not be easily forgotten that Abstract Expressionism itself grew directly out of the meeting of American (particularly New York) artists with European Surrealists self-exiled during World War II. In particular, Gorky and Paalen influenced the development of this American art form, which, as Surrealism did, celebrated the instantaneous human act as the well-spring of creativity. The early work of many Abstract Expressionists reveals a tight bond between the more superficial aspects of both movements, and the emergence (at a later date) of aspects of Dadaistic humor in such artists as Rauschenberg sheds an even starker light upon the connection. Up until the emergence of Pop Art, Surrealism can be seen to have been the single most important influence on the sudden growth in American arts, and even in Pop, some of the humor manifested in Surrealism can be found, often turned to a cultural criticism.",CAR_b9b782041a95631ab74c8efffd510dda98e58697,0," The Fin de sicle movement of the Belle poque persisted into the 20th century, but was brutally cut short with the outbreak of World War I (an effect depicted e.g. in Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain, published 1924).

She graduated from the School of Visual Arts in New York City where she received a BFA. Her work has appeared in several exhibitions, including solo shows in Seattle, Santa Monica, New York City and London.  Earleys paintings and drawings were so unique in fact, that she was quickly acclaimed as an exceptional, new talent, praised for her rare, signature authentic portraiture. Her stylized, elongated subjects echoed Mannerist elements and the dramatic lighting of the Baroque period, a technique she learned by the teachings of the School of Visual Arts. Her eccentric, accentuated realism drew attention from galleries, established artists and collectors, which immediately propelled Earley to the forefront of a burgeoning art movement. Her recognition as a leading female contemporary master painter grew internationally and moved Earley into the celebrated realm of solo exhibitions in Seattle, Los Angeles, New York City and London. NY Arts Magazine wrote in their MarchApril 2008 issue, Lori Earley is the leading female artist of the burgeoning Pop Surrealism Movement.

As American poet Kenneth Rexroth explains, Cubism in poetry is the conscious, deliberate dissociation and recombination of elements into a new artistic entity made self-sufficient by its rigorous architecture. This is quite different from the free association of the Surrealists and the combination of unconscious utterance and political nihilism of Dada. Nonetheless, the Cubist poets' influence on both Cubism and the later movements of Dada and Surrealism was profound; Louis Aragon, founding member of Surrealism, said that for Breton, Soupault, luard and himself, Reverdy was our immediate elder, the exemplary poet. Though not as well remembered as the Cubist painters, these poets continue to influence and inspire; American poets John Ashbery and Ron Padgett have recently produced new translations of Reverdy's work.

This has caused a disconnect between his full-on popular fame and the lack of esteem with which he has been viewed in the art world. His originality and mastery of graphic techniques is respected, but his works have been thought too intellectual and insufficiently lyrical. Movements such as conceptual art have to a degree reversed the art world's attitude to intellectuality and lyricism, but this did not rehabilitate Escher because traditional critics still disliked his narrative themes and his use of perspective. However, these same qualities made his work highly attractive to the public. Escher is not the first artist to explore mathematical themes: Parmigianino (15031540) had explored spherical geometry and reflection in his 1524 Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror, depicting his own image in a curved mirror, while William Hogarth's 1754 Satire on False Perspective, foreshadows Escher's playful exploration of errors in perspective. Another early artistic forerunner is Giovanni Battista Piranesi (17201778), whose dark fantastical prints such as The Drawbridge in his Carceri (Prisons) sequence depict perspectives into complex architecture with many stairs and ramps, peopled by walking figures. Only with 20th century movements such as Cubism, De Stijl, Dadaism and Surrealism did mainstream art start to explore Escher-like ways of looking at the world with multiple simultaneous viewpoints. However, while Escher had much in common with, for example, Magritte's surrealism, he did not make contact with any of these movements.",CAR_d88ec27c828ad6286e790840ffdcb5de6dcc9750,0,,

During 1913 he exhibited his work at the Salon des Indpendants and Salon dAutomne, where his work was noticed by Pablo Picasso, Guillaume Apollinaire, and others. His compelling and mysterious paintings are considered instrumental to the early beginnings of Surrealism.

Blender Music wrote that unlike Sk8er Boi the up-with-abstinence single Dont Tell Me finds her kicking him out of bed. The Guardian was mixed: Current single Don't Tell Me at least has some relevant advice to impart to her pubescent female fans: it depicts a confused and angry Lavigne fending off an over-eager boyfriend. PopMatters was favorable: The first single, Don't Tell Me, is probably the best song on the album, with the kind of wonderfully effusive movement that makes the best pop so damn irresistible. It starts slow and quiet, building to the first chorus, ebbs back, builds to another chorus, drops down into a bridge before coming back with a skull-crunching third chorus that leaves the riff firmly implanted in your skull. One or two reprises and we're out like a light, end of song. At that point you're either convinced or not.

The syntax may be tortured, but the singer sounds just fine: a righteous prude, confidently fending off the creeps. Yahoo Music! liked the song but was angry because there are spelling mistakes in booklet: we now have a stronger, more confident Avril - forthright in her determination not to lose her cherry on Dont Tell Me, which coyly spells ass with an a and two asterixes on the CD booklet, bitterly writing songs about doomed relationships.",CAR_f66fef92a3f945635d9ced28c780a571d92ac6ca,0," Dau al Set  was heavily influenced by two movements before its creation, those two being Dadaism and Surrealism.  Dadaism was a Europen art movement in the early 20th century which focused on the avant-garde. This style was meant to fight against the bourgeois in society with the belief that their reason and logic were the cause of war. With an anti-reason and anti-logic sentiment most of the works of art often contained elements of chaos and irrationality. Dadaist art also utilized the following techniques of cubism, collages, cut-up technique, photomontages, and assemblage which can be seen in Dau al Set's work. From this movement spawned the pre-war avant-garde which was the community Dau al Set were trying to revive.

Even in the many movies he made for hire (rather than for his own creative reasons), such as Susana and The Great Madcap, he usually added his trademark of disturbing and surreal images.  Some critics have pointed out that one reason why Buuel found working in Mexico so congenial was that what might seem unusual or even outlandish in Europe or the United States fit comfortably with elements of Mexican culture and the audience's expectations of national melodrama.  As filmmaker Toms Prez Turrent has commented, when referring to the apparently incredible features that many critics find in Buuel's films: In Mexico, it's believable, while one of the founders of Surrealism, Andr Breton, called Mexico, the most surrealist country in the world.   Certainly, running through the more personal films of Buuel's early and late years is a backbone of surrealism;  Buuel's world is one in which an entire dinner party suddenly finds itself inexplicably unable to leave the room and go home, a bad dream hands a man a letter which he brings to the doctor the next day, and where the devil, if unable to tempt a saint with a pretty girl, will fly him to a disco.

Her first major exhibition was in 1939 in New York at Julian Levys Gallery.  Fini was considered part of a pre-war generation of Parisian artists, and outlived most of her artist peers. Surrealist artists in France became very interested in her once she began setting herself up as an artist, and came to know her as important in the movement. She is mentioned in most comprehensive works about surrealism, although some leave her out (interestingly enough she did not consider herself a surrealist). In 1949 Frederick Ashton choreographed a ballet conceptualized by Fini, Le Rve de Leonor (Leonor's Dream) with music by Benjamin Britten. In London, she exhibited at the Kaplan gallery in 1960 and at the Hanover Gallery in 1967.  In the summer of 1986 there was a retrospective at the Muse du Luxembourg in Paris that drew in more than 5,000 people a day. It featured over 260 works in a variety of media. A tribute to the many artistic and creative avenues that her career took throughout her lifetime, there were 100+ watercolors and drawings, around 80 theatrecostume designs, and about 70 paintings, 5 masks, etc.  Many of her paintings featured women in positions of power; an example of this is the painting  La Bout du Monde where a female figure is submerged in water up to her breasts with human and animal skulls surrounding her. Madonna used the imagery in her video, Bedtime Story in 2006. In the spring of 1987 she had an exhibition at Londons Editions Graphiques gallery.Fini was also featured in an exhibition entitled Women, Surrealism, and Self-representation at the San Francisco Modern Museum of Art in 1999.",CAR_183af33ef0ee9d29cd71258799ec8fb5ba0e9ed3,0," Tell me whats your name girl, (yeah) tell me whats your name girl.

The artist's written commentaries are influenced by the tenets of Existentialist philosophy. These social commentaries contribute to an understanding of the Verdadism painting by describing the emotions, situations, and experiences that became the impetus for creating the work-of-art.

Expressionist works were painted largely between World War I and World War II, mostly in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Austria. Expressionist styles are related to those of both Surrealism and Symbolism and are each uniquely and somewhat eccentrically personal. Fauvism, Die Brcke, and Der Blaue Reiter are three of the best known groups of Expressionist and Symbolist painters. Artists as interesting and diverse as Marc Chagall, whose painting I and the Village, (above) tells an autobiographical story that examines the relationship between the artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic Symbolism. Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, Edvard Munch, Emil Nolde, Chaim Soutine, James Ensor, Oskar Kokoschka, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Max Beckmann, Franz Marc, Kthe Schmidt Kollwitz, Georges Rouault, Amedeo Modigliani and some of the Americans abroad like Marsden Hartley, and Stuart Davis, were considered influential expressionist painters. Although Alberto Giacometti is primarily thought of as an intense Surrealist sculptor, he made intense expressionist paintings as well.In the USA during the period between World War I and World War II painters tended to go to Europe for recognition. Modernist artists like Marsden Hartley, Patrick Henry Bruce, Gerald Murphy and Stuart Davis, created reputations abroad. While Patrick Henry Bruce, created cubist related paintings in Europe, both Stuart Davis and Gerald Murphy made paintings that were early inspirations for American pop art and Marsden Hartley experimented with expressionism. During the 1920s photographer Alfred Stieglitz exhibited Georgia O'Keeffe, Arthur Dove, Alfred Henry Maurer, Charles Demuth, John Marin and other artists including European Masters Henri Matisse, Auguste Rodin, Henri Rousseau, Paul Czanne, and Pablo Picasso, at his New York City gallery the 291.

In a body of work totaling hundreds of volumes, Isou and the Lettrists have applied their theories to all areas of art and culture, most notably in poetry, film, painting and political theory. The movement has its theoretical roots in Dada and Surrealism. Isou viewed his fellow countryman, Tristan Tzara, as the greatest creator and rightful leader of the Dada movement, and dismissed most of the others as plagiarists and falsifiers. Among the Surrealists, Andr Breton was a significant influence, but Isou was dissatisfied by what he saw as the stagnation and theoretical bankruptcy of the movement as it stood in the 1940s.",CAR_059c6c3a3c9384f01893ae7363c57da86ce7aa70,0," And on the driving force of the LowbrowPop Surrealism art movement:",CAR_09bfd9884fc3509c54976a952e611515a27d3367,0," A strong visual identity was developed by the band, from their clothes (notably featuring cycling tops, the idea for which came after seeing a cyclist standing at the bar in The Faversham public house in Leeds) to their cover art.

After Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase became the international cause celebre at the 1913 Armory show in New York he created the The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, Large Glass. The Large Glass pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp became closely associated with the Dada movement that began in neutral Zurich, Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Francis Picabia (see above), Man Ray, Kurt Schwitters, Tristan Tzara, Hans Richter, Jean Arp, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several Dadaists are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.In 1924 Andr Breton published the Surrealist Manifesto. The Surrealist movement in painting became synonymous with the avant-garde and which featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like Machine Turn Quickly, (above) Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the Dada movement through 1919 in Zurich and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in Surrealist art. Yves Tanguy, Ren Magritte and Salvador Dal are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. Joan Mir's The Tilled Field of 19231924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Mir's first Surrealist masterpiece. Mir's The Tilled Field also contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work that Mir saw as a young painter in The Prado. The more abstract Joan Mir, Jean Arp, Andr Masson, and Max Ernst were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A Surrealist group developed in Britain and, according to Breton, their 1936 London International Surrealist Exhibition was a high water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions.

This was the basis for Concrete art and Surrealism which became the latest trend in the international Avant-garde movement. The association of Abstraction and Surrealism was pioneered by Vilhelm Bjerke-Petersen who in 1930 joined the Bauhaus School in Weimar, a key Avant-garde institution which revolutionized not just painting but architecture, sculpture, literature, theatre and dance. Bauhaus is remembered for its influence on Abstract art and Functionalist architecture and design. At the Bauhaus, Bjerke Petersen had studied under Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee and was thus familiar with contemporary theories of abstract art. This led to the publication in 1933 of Symboler i abstrakt kunst (Symbols in Abstract Art) which served as a manifesto for the movement in Denmark.",CAR_355d77842d4050553c2fa7e7cd694f927ff6926f,0," Surrealist cinema is a modernist approach to film theory, criticism, and production with origins in Paris in the 1920s.

In their 1945 essay, Dialectique de la dialectique (Dialectic of Dialectics) (Bucharest, S Surralisme series), Trost and Luca decried the imperialist war, criticized Breton for failing to keep up with the progress of Hegelian and Marxist dialectics, and demanded a theoretical reexamination of surrealism. Naum, Teodorescu, and Pun's manifesto of the same year, Critica mizeriei (The Critique of Misery) (Bucharest, Surrealist Collection), which in a footnote criticized Luca for mysticism, has also been considered inspired by proletkult. However, according to a different perspective, the group by and large, while holding on to a leftist orientation, had in fact by then moved away from a Marxist view of social change and direct political involvement, working instead toward a revolution from within. This is evidenced by their collective 1946 text (Infra-noir: Prliminaires...), analyzed in this light by Eburne in Yaari, ed., under a motto taken from Pun's 1947 La Conspiration du silence: The Revolution is ungraspable. According to Yaari, this second view applies to Pun as well, who, in the somewhat hermetic style that had become characteristic of the group, wrote, also in 1947, in Les Esprits animaux: only the systematic blinding toward the partial lights of the has-been, of political and theoretical dj-vus, will provide us with the (magic) practical freedom of influencing the future with our movements. It is the dialectics of despair, its miracle, that sets now automatic action against the conspiracy of asphyxiation ....

Expressionist works were painted largely between World War I and World War II, mostly in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Austria. Expressionist styles are related to those of both Surrealism and Symbolism and are each uniquely and somewhat eccentrically personal. Fauvism, Die Brcke, and Der Blaue Reiter are three of the best known groups of Expressionist and Symbolist painters. Artists as interesting and diverse as Marc Chagall, whose painting I and the Village, (above) tells an autobiographical story that examines the relationship between the artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic Symbolism.

Although Alberto Giacometti is primarily thought of as an intense Surrealist sculptor, he made intense expressionist paintings as well.In the USA during the period between World War I and World War II painters tended to go to Europe for recognition. Modernist artists like Marsden Hartley, Patrick Henry Bruce, Gerald Murphy and Stuart Davis, created reputations abroad.

After Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase became the international cause celebre at the 1913 Armory show in New York he created the The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, Large Glass. The Large Glass pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp became closely associated with the Dada movement that began in neutral Zurich, Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Francis Picabia (see above), Man Ray, Kurt Schwitters, Tristan Tzara, Hans Richter, Jean Arp, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several Dadaists are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.In 1924 Andr Breton published the Surrealist Manifesto. The Surrealist movement in painting became synonymous with the avant-garde and which featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like Machine Turn Quickly, (above) Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the Dada movement through 1919 in Zurich and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in Surrealist art. Yves Tanguy, Ren Magritte and Salvador Dal are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. Joan Mir's The Tilled Field of 19231924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Mir's first Surrealist masterpiece. Mir's The Tilled Field also contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work that Mir saw as a young painter in The Prado. The more abstract Joan Mir, Jean Arp, Andr Masson, and Max Ernst were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large.

After Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase became the international cause celebre at the 1913 Armory show in New York he created the The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, Large Glass. The Large Glass pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp became closely associated with the Dada movement that began in neutral Zurich, Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Francis Picabia (see above), Man Ray, Kurt Schwitters, Tristan Tzara, Hans Richter, Jean Arp, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several Dadaists are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.In 1924 Andr Breton published the Surrealist Manifesto. The Surrealist movement in painting became synonymous with the avant-garde and which featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like Machine Turn Quickly, (above) Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the Dada movement through 1919 in Zurich and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in Surrealist art. Yves Tanguy, Ren Magritte and Salvador Dal are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. Joan Mir's The Tilled Field of 19231924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Mir's first Surrealist masterpiece. Mir's The Tilled Field also contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work that Mir saw as a young painter in The Prado. The more abstract Joan Mir, Jean Arp, Andr Masson, and Max Ernst were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A Surrealist group developed in Britain and, according to Breton, their 1936 London International Surrealist Exhibition was a high water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions.

Pop Art also marks its influences from Dada because, like the ready-mades which used commonplace items in a way that they were not originally intended.

It could be said that digital performance can be linked to the aesthetics, philosophies and practices of the futurist movement.

Surrealism as a political force developed unevenly around the world, in some places more emphasis being put on artistic practices, while in others political practises outweighed. In other places still, Surrealist praxis looked to overshadow both the arts and politics. Politically, Surrealism was ultra-leftist, communist, or anarchist.

In another instance, Tzara and his associates lectured at the Universit populaire in front of industrial workers, who were reportedly less than impressed.

There is a strong historical connection between Franz Roh's concept of magic realism and surrealism, as well as the resulting influence on Carpentier's marvelous reality; however, important differences remain. Surrealism is most distanced from magical realism in that the aspects that it explores are associated not with material reality but with the imagination and the mind, and in particular it attempts to express the 'inner life' and psychology of humans through art. It seeks to express the sub-conscious, unconscious, the repressed and inexpressible. Magical realism, on the other hand, rarely presents the extraordinary in the form of a dream or a psychological experience. To do so, Bowers writes, takes the magic of recognizable material reality and places it into the little understood world of the imagination.

This came as a critique of the scientific method and rationalism as human explanations of the world, notably outlined in his own Faux trait d'esthtique. Probably developed independently from Shestovist thought, his overall objection toward abstract projects has been likened by essayist Gina Sebastian Alcalay to the later stances of Andr Glucksmann or Edgar Morin. These attitudes shaped his assessments of Surrealism. In one of Integral chronicles, Fondane himself explained that the movement, described as superior to Dada's joyous suicide, had created a new continent with its rediscovery of dreams. Poet and critic Armelle Chitrit notes that, in part, Fondane's later dissidence was also motivated on an existentialist level, since Surrealism had stopped asking questions; instead, she notes, Fondane believed neither in reason nor in any system based on it. It is folly, he wrote, to perpetuate the attempt to make man and history cohabitable. One of Shestov's rare disciples, he sets only the powers of life against those of chaos. As Fondane wrote to Claude Sernet, Rimbaud le voyou was in part at attempt at preventing the other Surrealists from confiscating Rimbaud's mythical status. According to Romanian-born writer Lucian Raicu, its somber tone and allusive language are also early clues that Fondane had a nightmarish vision of the political and intellectual climate. His Shestovist interpretation, opposing existence to ideas, was contested by intellectual figure Raymond Queneau: himself a former Surrealist, Queneau suggested that Fondane was relying on blind faith, having a distorted perspective on science, literature and the human intellect. Furthermore, he noted that, under the influence of Lucien Lvy-Bruhl, Fondane described reality exclusively in primitivist terms, as the realm of savagery and superstition.",CAR_f385781125a99c56e30b8ded58742b0334b376fe,0," Der Sturm () was a German art and literary magazine covering Expressionism, Cubism, Dada and Surrealism, among other artistic movements.

After Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase became the international cause celebre at the 1913 Armory show in New York he created the The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, Large Glass. The Large Glass pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp became closely associated with the Dada movement that began in neutral Zurich, Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Francis Picabia (see above), Man Ray, Kurt Schwitters, Tristan Tzara, Hans Richter, Jean Arp, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several Dadaists are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.In 1924 Andr Breton published the Surrealist Manifesto. The Surrealist movement in painting became synonymous with the avant-garde and which featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like Machine Turn Quickly, (above) Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the Dada movement through 1919 in Zurich and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in Surrealist art. Yves Tanguy, Ren Magritte and Salvador Dal are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. Joan Mir's The Tilled Field of 19231924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Mir's first Surrealist masterpiece. Mir's The Tilled Field also contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work that Mir saw as a young painter in The Prado. The more abstract Joan Mir, Jean Arp, Andr Masson, and Max Ernst were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A Surrealist group developed in Britain and, according to Breton, their 1936 London International Surrealist Exhibition was a high water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions.

Some of Urmuz's commentators therefore discussed him as a reader of the unconscious mind or propagator of esoteric knowledge, suggesting that a hidden layer of mystical symbolism can be discerned in all his activities. According to Perpessicius, the Bizarre Pages as a whole carry a subtext of mythopoeia, or fragments of a new mythology. Boz also drew a comparison between Urmuz and the morose poems of George Bacovia, arguing that they both send the reader on tragic explorations and journeys to the underworld. In Boz's interpretation, Urmuz was not at all a humorist, but rather one who issued a solitary call to order and, creating a magical phenomenon, elevated his reader above the realities of the flesh. He first discussed the connection between the Bizarre Pages and 1930s Surrealism, which likewise turned its attention to the abnormal psychology, to psychosis and dementia.

Early works of his were surrealistic, but in 1953 he began working in abstract art.  It is here that he becomes a part of the Art Informel movement and starts working with mixed media. Art Informel in Europe was the equivalent to Abstract Expressionism in America.  This was among the most prevalent styles of art in post-war Europe.

According to Francis, the juxtaposition between the old and the present day is what makes Afro-Surrealism so unique. As Francis puts it, Surrealism here, the Afro-surreal, like the marvelous discussed above, is actually a realism so real, so contrary to the norms of publicized blackness, that it represents a rupture, a radical break from ordinary understanding such that the old feels newbecause it was never known. Although this movement is related to Afrofuturism, it is different in that instead of focusing on the future, Afro-Surrealism focuses more on the present day.",CAR_3022151fc2191b1d403feb7293b3ed250338eac3,0," While Dadaist pieces cannot be determined through a particular artistic form, many Dadaist artists collaborated in groups with each other in order to create their art, united on either to create art based on social issues (particularly in Europe) or to mock the art world in general (mostly in America). In America, the center of this movement came from two locations in the New York-area:  at Alfred Stieglitzs New York gallery 291, and at the studio of Walter Arensberg. In addition to group collaboration, artists of the Dada movement depended more on spontaneity and chance than following other established artists. They focused on rejecting the ideas formed by established artists and art creation and used methods such as collage, photomontage, and found-object construction to create their art. While this art form started strong in 1916 in Germany, it eventually faded out by 1922 in both Europe and America.

By subverting the reader's expectations through constant non-sequiturs, Barthelme creates a hopelessly fragmented verbal collage reminiscent of such modernist works as T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land and James Joyce's Ulysses, whose linguistic experiments he often challenged. However, Barthelme's fundamental skepticism and irony distanced him from the modernists' belief in the power of art to reconstruct society, leading most critics to class him as a postmodernist writer. Literary critics have noted that Barthelme, like the French poet Stphane Mallarm, whom he admired, plays with the meanings of words, relying on poetic intuition to spark new connections of ideas buried in the expressions and conventional responses. The critic George Wicks called Barthelme the leading American practitioner of surrealism today...whose fiction continues the investigations of consciousness and experiments in expression that began with Dada and surrealism a half century ago.

There are three main periods that can be highlighted in the history of multi - media performance; Futurism during the 1910s, mixed media performance during the 1960s and experimentation with a performance and the computer during the 1990s. Both during the eras of Futurism and the experimentation with computer incorporated within performance, they are both greatly inspired by the development of new and existing technology. Researching back, digital performance practices have experimented with numerous of the different avant  garde movements which can date right back from the early twentieth century, some of these movements can include the likes of Bauhaus, Dada, Surrealism and many more. It could be said that digital performance can be linked to the aesthetics, philosophies and practices of the futurist movement. One of the main links that has been found which can connect futurism to digital performance was with the use of the machine which was used in the set of Robert Lepages Zulu Time (1999).

This was the basis for Concrete art and Surrealism which became the latest trend in the international Avant-garde movement. The association of Abstraction and Surrealism was pioneered by Vilhelm Bjerke-Petersen who in 1930 joined the Bauhaus School in Weimar, a key Avant-garde institution which revolutionized not just painting but architecture, sculpture, literature, theatre and dance. Bauhaus is remembered for its influence on Abstract art and Functionalist architecture and design. At the Bauhaus, Bjerke Petersen had studied under Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee and was thus familiar with contemporary theories of abstract art.

After attending courses on Zen Buddhism taught by D. T.

A major influence is found in the work of Marcel Duchamp. Also of importance was Dada Poets and Painters, edited by Robert Motherwell, a book of translations of Dada texts that was widely read by members of Fluxus. The term anti-art, a precursor to Dada, was coined by Duchamp around 1913, when he created his first readymades from found objects (ordinary objects found or purchased and declared art). Indifferently chosen, readymades and altered readymades challenged the notion of art as an inherently optical experience, dependent on academic art skills. The most famous example is Duchamp's infamous altered readymade Fountain (1917), a work which he signed R. Mutt. While taking refuge from WWI in New York, in 1915 Duchamp formed a Dada group with Francis Picabia and American artist Man Ray. Other key members included Arthur Craven, Florine Stettheimer, and the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, credited by some with proposing the idea for Fountain to Duchamp. By 1916 these artists, especially Duchamp, Man Ray, and Picabia became the center for radical anti-art activities in New York City. Their artworks would inform Fluxus and conceptual art in general.

His art pushes his audience into areas where people feel less than comfortable, stating that the US which is so puritanical, our bodies are usually a great source of anxiety and fear. As a production designer, he has designed over fifteen independent feature films in the past decade as well as numerous commercials and music videos.   He is best known as the director for the music videos Blue and Looking Glass by The Birthday Massacre, receiving over 4 million combined views on YouTube, and has directed music videos for the industrial band Android Lust. He has done production design for many films over the years including Chasing Sleep starring Jeff Daniels. Dan's artwork is strongly themed around surrealism and mostly done in pencil. As an artist he has exhibited widely. He has been published in numerous anthology art books including Bio-Mannerism which also features work by H.R.

The Dadaists claimed that Dada was not an art movement, but an anti-art movement, sometimes using found objects in a manner similar to found poetry. The anti-art drive is thought to have stemmed from a post-war emptiness. This tendency toward devaluation of art has led many to claim that Dada was an essentially nihilistic movement.

By positioning the work of both artists next to one an other Dr. Kramm demonstrated that, what Redeker in his philosophical approach to the origins and developments of Stahls work had already formulated in detail, pertained equally so to the work of Fritz Winter. They can be summarised in a very condensed form as follows:That what fascinates me more and more over the years, as a possible access to the art of Georg Stahl, is the fact that the entire Time-Space question and the manner in which it is being answered in today's philosophical anthropology is of fundamental importance also for that what manifests itself, mainly unconsciously and at a far distance from any philosophical thinking as the road of the visual arts of our century. This Time-Space question revolves around the philosophical interpretation of man : ....not as an object, as a substantial thing with properties, but as a living externalization of all his activities, that are characteristic for his being a human. ,  .....man finds himself with thousands of fine threads outside of himself, he is spread out in time and space One of the consequences, which this definition has for modern art, as Redeker continues to argue is, that by radically turning his back on the perspective space illusion with its entire richness of pictorial possibilities, he (the artist) had to base his form problems on the fundamental facts of canvas and paint: Paint as a means of illusion distanced us from our bodily togetherness with the painting... From now on the point of departure for the painter is a new spatiality, since: ....he is not any more a 'subject' that possesses also eyes and sees with these eyes perspective space in front of him, but a human being with the consciousness of his own bodily existence, which not only has a body, but is also body. It suffices to mention here, without entering into further details, that this new relationship artistpainting has far reaching implications for the relation between the painting and its physical surroundings, because:  We stand in front of a radical contrast with the last great stylistic period (in architecture), the Baroque, in which architecture completed itself beyond the sculptural and dynamic elements into the perspective pseudo spaces of painting. By now 'free painting' creates its own monumentality, 'free painting' is monumental in itself, because what it instills as color space and movement, never breaks out of the clear spaces created by the architect.

It emphasized speed, technology, youth, and violence, and objects such as the car, the aeroplane, and the industrial city. Although it was largely an Italian phenomenon, there were parallel movements in Russia, England, Belgium and elsewhere. The Futurists practiced in every medium of art including painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, urban design, theatre, film, fashion, textiles, literature, music, architecture, and even gastronomy. Its key figures were the Italians Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carr, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, Antonio Sant'Elia, Bruno Munari, Benedetta Cappa and Luigi Russolo, the Russians Natalia Goncharova, Velimir Khlebnikov, Igor Severyanin, David Burliuk, Aleksei Kruchenykh and Vladimir Mayakovsky, the Belgian Jules Schmalzigaug and the Portuguese Almada Negreiros. It glorified modernity and aimed to liberate Italy from the weight of its past. Cubism contributed to the formation of Italian Futurism's artistic style. Important Futurist works included Marinetti's Manifesto of Futurism, Boccioni's sculpture Unique Forms of Continuity in Space, and Balla's painting Abstract Speed + Sound (pictured). To some extent Futurism influenced the art movements Art Deco, Constructivism, Surrealism, Dada, and to a greater degree Precisionism, Rayonism, and Vorticism.",CAR_e32722468e4e86b12b7d4dfd77f3effba55caa6b,0," In the art world, Surrealism was attempting to shock the world with their games and bizarre behavior. The Surrealists were at one and the same time a serious art movement and a parody of other art forms and political movements. Surrealism had been developed by Andr Breton and others from the Dada movement. Based in several European countries, Surrealism was destined for trouble when the Nazis came to power. Subcultures and degenerate art were almost completely stamped out and replaced by the Hitler Youth.",CAR_e54f75663a9058326e7540c49fa496fb6c14dadd,0," The early Futurist movement began with Filippo Marinettis Futurist Manifesto in 1909 and is followed up by Umberto Boccionis 1910 manifesto, The City Rises. The manifestos represent the Futurists statement of artistic purpose and defined the creative work of its founders and later followers. Balla, among other artists, signed his name at the bottom of the latter manifesto and would later go on to publish his own renditions of the Futurist mission. The Futurists lived in a time of fierce social and political change. The industrial world was unfolding as technology continued to advance. They were quite avant-garde and used materials indicative of a modern age, as exemplified in Boccionis bronze Unique Forms of Continuity in Space. The Italian dictionary defines futurism as  wanting to make a clean slate of the past and traditional forms of expression to make way for the inquisition of dynamic modern life, a mechanical civilization projecting into the future in a riot of senses. The movement is all about literal and figurative movement on both individual and larger, national scales. Physical movement often is used in Futurist art to represent machinery, which in turn represents technology and ultimately our progress and movement as a civilization into the future. The Futurists were a very extreme bunch; not one of them was over the age of thirty and they considered war the worlds own hygiene. They opposed ideas of morality and feminism, and saw great promise in speed. Their world was hurtling into the future, and there was time only to depict only the truly beautiful. In 1909, they wrote, Beauty exists only in struggle. There is no masterpiece that has not an aggressive character. Poetry must be a violent assault on the forces of the unknown, to force them to bow before man.  The Futuristic style borrows from other forward thinking movements: Post-Impressionism, Symbolism, Divisionism, Cubism and Pointillism.",CAR_e9a41c6b52a96e04fc8b585e2c16b6ea67ba8660,0," Magic realism, a popular technique among novelists of the latter half of the 20th century especially among Latin American writers, has some obvious similarities to Surrealism with its juxtaposition of the normal and the dream-like, as in the work of Gabriel Garca Mrquez.

Expressionist styles are related to those of both Surrealism and Symbolism and are each uniquely and somewhat eccentrically personal. Fauvism, Die Brcke, and Der Blaue Reiter are three of the best known groups of Expressionist and Symbolist painters. Artists as interesting and diverse as Marc Chagall, whose painting I and the Village, (above) tells an autobiographical story that examines the relationship between the artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic Symbolism. Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, Edvard Munch, Emil Nolde, Chaim Soutine, James Ensor, Oskar Kokoschka, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Max Beckmann, Franz Marc, Kthe Schmidt Kollwitz, Georges Rouault, Amedeo Modigliani and some of the Americans abroad like Marsden Hartley, and Stuart Davis, were considered influential expressionist painters. Although Alberto Giacometti is primarily thought of as an intense Surrealist sculptor, he made intense expressionist paintings as well.In the USA during the period between World War I and World War II painters tended to go to Europe for recognition. Modernist artists like Marsden Hartley, Patrick Henry Bruce, Gerald Murphy and Stuart Davis, created reputations abroad. While Patrick Henry Bruce, created cubist related paintings in Europe, both Stuart Davis and Gerald Murphy made paintings that were early inspirations for American pop art and Marsden Hartley experimented with expressionism. During the 1920s photographer Alfred Stieglitz exhibited Georgia O'Keeffe, Arthur Dove, Alfred Henry Maurer, Charles Demuth, John Marin and other artists including European Masters Henri Matisse, Auguste Rodin, Henri Rousseau, Paul Czanne, and Pablo Picasso, at his New York City gallery the 291.

Later he abandoned nihilism for Surrealism and Marxism. For the first time in its history, Romanian culture was fully connected to Western culture, while Dadaism is the first Romanian artistic and literary movement to become international. Dadaism and Surrealism are fundamental parts of the avant-garde, the most revolutionary form of modernism.

In the later part of the decade, he abandoned composing songs with Asia Minor instruments, i.e. outi, lyre, and violin, and wrote songs using the bouzouki.

Her first major exhibition was in 1939 in New York at Julian Levys Gallery.  Fini was considered part of a pre-war generation of Parisian artists, and outlived most of her artist peers. Surrealist artists in France became very interested in her once she began setting herself up as an artist, and came to know her as important in the movement. She is mentioned in most comprehensive works about surrealism, although some leave her out (interestingly enough she did not consider herself a surrealist). In 1949 Frederick Ashton choreographed a ballet conceptualized by Fini, Le Rve de Leonor (Leonor's Dream) with music by Benjamin Britten. In London, she exhibited at the Kaplan gallery in 1960 and at the Hanover Gallery in 1967.  In the summer of 1986 there was a retrospective at the Muse du Luxembourg in Paris that drew in more than 5,000 people a day. It featured over 260 works in a variety of media. A tribute to the many artistic and creative avenues that her career took throughout her lifetime, there were 100+ watercolors and drawings, around 80 theatrecostume designs, and about 70 paintings, 5 masks, etc.  Many of her paintings featured women in positions of power; an example of this is the painting  La Bout du Monde where a female figure is submerged in water up to her breasts with human and animal skulls surrounding her. Madonna used the imagery in her video, Bedtime Story in 2006. In the spring of 1987 she had an exhibition at Londons Editions Graphiques gallery.Fini was also featured in an exhibition entitled Women, Surrealism, and Self-representation at the San Francisco Modern Museum of Art in 1999.",CAR_183af33ef0ee9d29cd71258799ec8fb5ba0e9ed3,0," Balinese art forms are primarily classified under three major categories of which Batuan Style (distinct from the Ubud Style) which originated in Batuan is one style which has absorbed the traditional art form to the present dynamic art styles; the other two Bali art styles are the Ubud style of Ubed and the Sanur style which have been further supplemented by an Young Artists style of 1960s of Penestanan (the artists village) origin influenced by the Dutch artists. In the Batuan style of painting, the emphasis is adoption of sombre colour, generally in black and white with preponderance of  mystic Balinese religious ethos related to sorcery and witchcraft. They are also famous for the miniature painting with great attention paid to detailing. The artists have an eye for detail as they  paint with great patience. Vegetation is drawn in a stylised format, but each leaf is painted and shaded. The patterns, even in batik sarongs, have the minor figures drawn very carefully. Even the open space is filled with pulsating marks. Scenes emerge from the canvas and retreat into the vegetation such as a dog fight, a love affair, a group of gamblers, all shown in a corner of the canvas.

After Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase became the international cause celebre at the 1913 Armory show in New York he created the The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, Large Glass. The Large Glass pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp became closely associated with the Dada movement that began in neutral Zurich, Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Francis Picabia (see above), Man Ray, Kurt Schwitters, Tristan Tzara, Hans Richter, Jean Arp, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several Dadaists are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.In 1924 Andr Breton published the Surrealist Manifesto. The Surrealist movement in painting became synonymous with the avant-garde and which featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like Machine Turn Quickly, (above) Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the Dada movement through 1919 in Zurich and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in Surrealist art. Yves Tanguy, Ren Magritte and Salvador Dal are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. Joan Mir's The Tilled Field of 19231924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Mir's first Surrealist masterpiece. Mir's The Tilled Field also contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work that Mir saw as a young painter in The Prado. The more abstract Joan Mir, Jean Arp, Andr Masson, and Max Ernst were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A Surrealist group developed in Britain and, according to Breton, their 1936 London International Surrealist Exhibition was a high water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions.

This was the case in his homeland during 1928, when the first avant-garde manifesto issued by unu magazine, written by Saa Pan and Moldov, cited as its mentors Tzara, writers Breton, Ribemont-Dessaignes, Vinea, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, and Tudor Arghezi, as well as artists Constantin Brncui and Theo van Doesburg. One of the Romanian writers to claim inspiration from Tzara was Jacques G. Costin, who nevertheless offered an equally good reception to both Dadaism and Futurism, while Ilarie Voronca's Zodiac cycle, first published in France, is traditionally seen as indebted to The Approximate Man. The Kabbalist and Surrealist author Marcel Avramescu, who wrote during the 1930s, also appears to have been directly inspired by Tzara's views on art. Other authors from that generation to have been inspired by Tzara were Polish Futurist writer Bruno Jasieski, Japanese poet and Zen thinker Takahashi Shinkichi, and Chilean poet and Dadaist sympathizer Vicente Huidobro, who cited him as a precursor for his own Creacionismo.",CAR_868d5fc50bef9c68e0919a83b86c4a243df3b55d,0,,

Western art schools were institutionalised and taught a variety of styles including Abstractionalism, New-Objectitivism, Neoclassicism, Cubism, Surrealism, Expressionism, Structuralism, Fauvism, Symbolism, Pop Art, Minimalism, Optical Art, and so on.  This brought about a revival of the Taiwanese Nativist art movement, in which Wu was extremely influential. In 1964, Wu joined the Modern Print Society and began to produce woodblock prints. The artist temporarily abandoned oil painting, as he believed that woodblock printing was a more successful method for capturing the Orients qualities, characteristics and identity.  The movement is thought to have emerged in 1949, and was typified by a deliberate rejection of Western art techniques that were initially introduced to Taiwan by the Japanese throughout their colonial rule. Furthermore, the movement aimed to portray indigenous Taiwanese cultural forms and their relationship to the Taiwanese social, economic, cultural and political identity.   Wu employed Nativism in his artwork to exert and explore national Taiwanese characteristics, particularly throughout the 1960s and 1970s when the movement was fruitfully revitalised.

The history of today's asemic movement stems from two Chinese calligraphers: crazy Zhang Xu, a Tang Dynasty (circa 800 CE) calligrapher who was famous for creating wild illegible calligraphy, and the younger drunk monk Huaisu who also excelled at illegible cursive calligraphy. In the 1920s Henri Michaux, who was influenced by Asian calligraphy and Surrealism, began to create wordless works such as Alphabet (1925) and Narration (1927). Michaux referred to his calligraphic works as interior Gestures. The writer and artist Wassily Kandinsky was an early precursor to asemic writing, with his linear piece Indian Story (1931) exemplifying complete textual abstraction. In the 1950s there is Brion Gysin, Isidore Isou, Cy Twombly, and Morita ShiryuBokujin-Kai Group all of whom expanded writing into illegible and wordless visual mark-making; they would help lay the foundation for asemic writers of the future. Mirtha Dermisache is another writer who had created asemic writing since the 1960s. Dermisache actively said that even though her graphisms have no meaning, they still retained the full rights of an autonomous work. 1971 was the year when Alain Sati released his work crit en prose ou L'uvre hypergraphique which contains asemic writing throughout the entire graphic novel. Len Ferrari was another artistpoet who created many asemic works in the 1960s and 70s, such as Escritura (1976). A modern example of asemic writing is Luigi Serafini's Codex Seraphinianus. Serafini described the script of the Codex as asemic in a talk at the Oxford University Society of Bibliophiles held on May 8, 2009. Roland Barthes was also involved with asemic writing; he titled his asemic works Contre-critures. 1974 saw the release of Max Ernst's work Maximiliana: The Illegal Practice Of Astronomy: hommage  Dorothea Tanning; this book is a major influence on asemic writers such as Tim Gaze, Michael Jacobson, and Derek Beaulieu. In the 1980s Chinese artist Xu Bing created Tinsh, or A Book from the Sky which is a work of books and hanging scrolls on which were printed 4000 hand carved meaningless characters. The 1980s also saw artist Gu Wenda begin the first of a series of projects centered on the invention of meaningless, false Chinese ideograms, depicted as if they were truly old and traditional. One exhibition of this type was held in Xi'an in 1986, featuring paintings of fake ideograms on a massive scale.  Also in China, during the 1990s, an abstract calligraphy movement known as Calligraphy-ism came into existence, a leading proponent of this movement being Luo Qi. Calligraphy-ism is an aesthetic movement that aims todevelop calligraphy into an abstract art. The characters do not need to retain their traditional forms or be legible as words. In Vietnam during the 2000s a calligraphy group called the Zenei Gang of Five appeared.

Many important artists fled to North America, and relative safety in the United States. The art community in New York City in particular was already grappling with Surrealist ideas and several artists like Arshile Gorky, Jackson Pollock, and Robert Motherwell converged closely with the surrealist artists themselves, albeit with some suspicion and reservations. Ideas concerning the unconscious and dream imagery were quickly embraced. By the Second World War, the taste of the American avant-garde in New York City swung decisively towards Abstract Expressionism with the support of key taste makers, including Peggy Guggenheim, Leo Steinberg and Clement Greenberg. However, it should not be easily forgotten that Abstract Expressionism itself grew directly out of the meeting of American (particularly New York) artists with European Surrealists self-exiled during World War II. In particular, Gorky and Paalen influenced the development of this American art form, which, as Surrealism did, celebrated the instantaneous human act as the well-spring of creativity.

He began to study social pedagogy after he was rejected by the Berlin University of the Arts (UdK). This was his profession until 1993. At the same time he exhibited his works in Augsburg and Berlin.

After Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase became the international cause celebre at the 1913 Armory show in New York he created the The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, Large Glass. The Large Glass pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp became closely associated with the Dada movement that began in neutral Zurich, Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Francis Picabia (see above), Man Ray, Kurt Schwitters, Tristan Tzara, Hans Richter, Jean Arp, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several Dadaists are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.In 1924 Andr Breton published the Surrealist Manifesto. The Surrealist movement in painting became synonymous with the avant-garde and which featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like Machine Turn Quickly, (above) Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the Dada movement through 1919 in Zurich and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in Surrealist art. Yves Tanguy, Ren Magritte and Salvador Dal are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. Joan Mir's The Tilled Field of 19231924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Mir's first Surrealist masterpiece. Mir's The Tilled Field also contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work that Mir saw as a young painter in The Prado. The more abstract Joan Mir, Jean Arp, Andr Masson, and Max Ernst were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A Surrealist group developed in Britain and, according to Breton, their 1936 London International Surrealist Exhibition was a high water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions.

Some of Urmuz's commentators therefore discussed him as a reader of the unconscious mind or propagator of esoteric knowledge, suggesting that a hidden layer of mystical symbolism can be discerned in all his activities. According to Perpessicius, the Bizarre Pages as a whole carry a subtext of mythopoeia, or fragments of a new mythology. Boz also drew a comparison between Urmuz and the morose poems of George Bacovia, arguing that they both send the reader on tragic explorations and journeys to the underworld. In Boz's interpretation, Urmuz was not at all a humorist, but rather one who issued a solitary call to order and, creating a magical phenomenon, elevated his reader above the realities of the flesh. He first discussed the connection between the Bizarre Pages and 1930s Surrealism, which likewise turned its attention to the abnormal psychology, to psychosis and dementia. The theoretical proto-Surrealism of such works, which places less importance on their topical humor, has generated a long debate between scholars later in the 20th century: some have denied Urmuzian Surrealism, whereas others have continued to identify him as the earliest Romanian Surrealist.",CAR_21496e6f88eef47449e3c6ded0be4e48d4bf15be,0," Well known examples include Leonardo da Vinci's depiction, which is considered the first work of High Renaissance art due to its high level of harmony, Tintoretto's depiction which is unusual in that it includes secondary characters carrying or taking the dishes from the table and Salvadore Dali's depiction combines the typical Christian themes with modern approaches of Surrealism.",CAR_2277bbbe31d665f49d700a046b67a9d5101c09f9,0," In June 2007, Daly organized a Progressive Convention to find a candidate to run against popular Mayor Gavin Newsom.

Both of these films, Un Chien Andalou and L'Age d'Or, have had a tremendous impact on the independent surrealist film movement.

Bonciu, he argues, gained an Expressionist profile by performing his own, independent, mix of literary themes: transcendence is borrowed from Neoromanticism, instinctual drive from Naturalism, subjectivity from Impressionism, and paneroticism from Jugendstil and Symbolism. Other literary historians presume the same connections. Dan Grigorescu suggests that Bonciu's Expressionism was mostly exterior, spread over Jugendstil, Impressionism, Surrealism and various eclectic mixtures; Marian Victor Buciu focuses on Bonciu as a meeting point between the Naturalist typology and Expressionism, noting that his Surrealism is less supplied. Nevertheless, Clinescu supposes an ideological link between Bonciu and the Romanian Surrealists at unu magazine, since a man with hatstand head sketch, by unu artists Jules Perahim, illustrated one of Bonciu's works. In Clinescu's interpretation, the grotesque drawing brings to life a moment of dementia, and this is analogous to Bonciu's own intentions: H.

In line with the Surrealist movement's objectives, Dal stated that his artistic aim was that ...the world of imagination and of concrete irrationality may be as objectively evident ... as that of the exterior world..., and this goal can be seen in his most familiar painting, The Persistence of Memory. Here he paints with a precise, realistic style, based on studies of Dutch and Spanish masters, but with a subject that dissolves the boundaries between organic and mechanical and is more akin to the nightmarish scenes of the Netherlandish painter Hieronymus Bosch, whose Garden of Earthly Delights provided the model for the central, sleeping figure of Dal's work.",CAR_381f1905e11bf863c520229566c9c7539c046a2a,0," Descharnes was born in Nevers on January 1, 1926.

In writing and in the visual arts, and by using automatic writing, creative games (like the cadavre exquis) and altered states (through alcohol and narcotics), the surrealists tried to reveal the workings of the unconscious mind.  The group championed previous writers they saw as radical (Arthur Rimbaud, the Comte de Lautramont, Baudelaire) and promoted an anti-bourgeois philosophy (particularly with regards to sex and politics) which would later lead most of them to join the communist party.  Other writers associated with surrealism include: Jean Cocteau, Ren Crevel, Jacques Prvert, Jules Supervielle, Benjamin Pret, Philippe Soupault, Pierre Reverdy, Antonin Artaud (who revolutionized theater), Henri Michaux and Ren Char.

The exhibit featured work by over seventy artists, including Gregory Crewdson, Mariko Mori, Ashley Bickerton, Art Spiegelman, Tony Oursler, and Cindy Sherman, and was memorialized in the 1999 book of the same name. Reviewing the exhibition for ArtForum, Steven Henry Madoff wrote: The mutant sensibility at work in this droll, smartly curated exhibition proposes the marriage of Surrealism's dream-laden fetish for the body eroticized and grotesque and Pop art's celebration of the shallower, corrosively bright world given over the packaged good. The New York Times said of the exhibit at first, Surrealism and popular culture would seem to be oil and water. Surrealism mines dreams and the unconscious, while popular culture is concerned with surface and commonplaces. But in recent years they have been brought together in exhibitions concerned with proving that High and Low are related.

Dali was also obsessed with the spiral, which he thought to be the most important feature in nature, and used it as a symbol of cosmic order.   Dali portrayed this idea by adding a spiral in the top right corner of his painting. Not only does Dali portray his objects flying around the scene, he shows them twisted in usual ways.

This was the case in his homeland during 1928, when the first avant-garde manifesto issued by unu magazine, written by Saa Pan and Moldov, cited as its mentors Tzara, writers Breton, Ribemont-Dessaignes, Vinea, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, and Tudor Arghezi, as well as artists Constantin Brncui and Theo van Doesburg. One of the Romanian writers to claim inspiration from Tzara was Jacques G. Costin, who nevertheless offered an equally good reception to both Dadaism and Futurism, while Ilarie Voronca's Zodiac cycle, first published in France, is traditionally seen as indebted to The Approximate Man. The Kabbalist and Surrealist author Marcel Avramescu, who wrote during the 1930s, also appears to have been directly inspired by Tzara's views on art. Other authors from that generation to have been inspired by Tzara were Polish Futurist writer Bruno Jasieski, Japanese poet and Zen thinker Takahashi Shinkichi, and Chilean poet and Dadaist sympathizer Vicente Huidobro, who cited him as a precursor for his own Creacionismo.",CAR_868d5fc50bef9c68e0919a83b86c4a243df3b55d,0,,

The artist never paints direct scenes of mass death. Instead, he employs allegory, metaphor and certain artistic devices such as substitution: toys instead of the murdered children who played with them, books, instead of the people who read them.  Further devices are quotations of iconographical prototyes, i.e. Michelangelo's Creation of Adam (151112) on the Sistine Ceiling or Albrecht Drer's famous engraving entitled Melencholia (1516). He turns these prototypes into ironical statements. Irony in the art of Samuel Bak does not mean parody or derision, but rather disenchantment, and the attempt to achieve distance from pain. Recurring symbols are: the Warsaw Ghetto Child, Crematorium Chimneys or vast backgrounds of Renaissance landscape that symbolize the indifference of the outside world.

Richardson writes: Within popular conceptions, surrealism is misunderstood in many different ways, some of which contradict others, but all of these misunderstandings are founded in the fact that they seek to reduce surrealism to a style or a thing in itself rather than being prepared to see it as an activity with broadening horizons. Many critics fail to recognize the distinctive qualities that make up the surrealist attitude. They seek something  a theme, a particular type of imagery, certain concepts  they can identify as 'surrealist' in order to provide a criterion of judgement by which a film or artwork can be appraised. The problem is that this goes against the very essence of surrealism, which refuses to be here but is always elsewhere. It is not a thing but a relation between things and therefore needs to be treated as a whole. Surrealists are not concerned with conjuring up some magic world that can be defined as 'surreal'. Their interest is almost exclusively in exploring the conjunctions, the points of contact, between different realms of existence. Surrealism is always about departures rather than arrivals. Rather than a fixed aesthetic, Richardson defines surrealism as a shifting point of magnetism around which the collective activity of the surrealists revolves.",CAR_ad6462b685238c405ae455aa3ddf228c52c9bf9c,0," Surrealism as a visual movement had found a method: to expose psychological truth; stripping ordinary objects of their normal significance, to create a compelling image that was beyond ordinary formal organization, in order to evoke empathy from the viewer.",CAR_af0f35366fd97d40f9400a0eb3d1b7e92482d7eb,0," Dada activities included public gatherings, demonstrations, and publication of artliterary journals; passionate coverage of art, politics, and culture were topics often discussed in a variety of media.

Many important artists fled to North America, and relative safety in the United States. The art community in New York City in particular was already grappling with Surrealist ideas and several artists like Arshile Gorky, Jackson Pollock, and Robert Motherwell converged closely with the surrealist artists themselves, albeit with some suspicion and reservations. Ideas concerning the unconscious and dream imagery were quickly embraced. By the Second World War, the taste of the American avant-garde in New York City swung decisively towards Abstract Expressionism with the support of key taste makers, including Peggy Guggenheim, Leo Steinberg and Clement Greenberg. However, it should not be easily forgotten that Abstract Expressionism itself grew directly out of the meeting of American (particularly New York) artists with European Surrealists self-exiled during World War II. In particular, Gorky and Paalen influenced the development of this American art form, which, as Surrealism did, celebrated the instantaneous human act as the well-spring of creativity. The early work of many Abstract Expressionists reveals a tight bond between the more superficial aspects of both movements, and the emergence (at a later date) of aspects of Dadaistic humor in such artists as Rauschenberg sheds an even starker light upon the connection. Up until the emergence of Pop Art, Surrealism can be seen to have been the single most important influence on the sudden growth in American arts, and even in Pop, some of the humor manifested in Surrealism can be found, often turned to a cultural criticism.",CAR_b9b782041a95631ab74c8efffd510dda98e58697,0,,

Duchamp can be seen as a precursor to conceptual art, other famous examples being John Cage's 4'33, which is four minutes and thirty three seconds of silence, and Rauschenberg's Erased de Kooning Drawing.

After Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase became the international cause celebre at the 1913 Armory show in New York he created the The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, Large Glass. The Large Glass pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp became closely associated with the Dada movement that began in neutral Zurich, Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Francis Picabia (see above), Man Ray, Kurt Schwitters, Tristan Tzara, Hans Richter, Jean Arp, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several Dadaists are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.In 1924 Andr Breton published the Surrealist Manifesto. The Surrealist movement in painting became synonymous with the avant-garde and which featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like Machine Turn Quickly, (above) Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the Dada movement through 1919 in Zurich and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in Surrealist art. Yves Tanguy, Ren Magritte and Salvador Dal are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. Joan Mir's The Tilled Field of 19231924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Mir's first Surrealist masterpiece. Mir's The Tilled Field also contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work that Mir saw as a young painter in The Prado. The more abstract Joan Mir, Jean Arp, Andr Masson, and Max Ernst were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A Surrealist group developed in Britain and, according to Breton, their 1936 London International Surrealist Exhibition was a high water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions.

The Nose was originally published in The Contemporary, a literary journal owned by Alexander Pushkin. The use of a nose as the main source of conflict in the story could have been due to Gogol's own experience with an oddly shaped nose, which was often the subject of self-deprecating jokes in letters.

Of far greater concern was Descharnes's role in persuading the elderly, infirm painter to transfer his copyright, in 1986, for a period of 20 years to a company managed by Descharnes. Gibson writes, The contract was prepared by the Madrid lawyer Miguel Domenech, who has said that at the time Dali, he and Dali's friend, Antoni Pitxot were under 'tremendous pressure' from a now power-hungry Descharnes. ... Even when he was well, Dali had never shown any interest in contracts, or any understanding of their small print. ... It is difficult to believe, therefore, that...he could have grasped its exact nature or its potential consequences. The painter, moreover, was in very poor physical condition at this time. Gibson, who calls Descharnes a very controversial figure in Spain, notes in a 1997 episode of the TV show Omnibus, about Dali and his work, that many of Dali's associates are still unhappy about this situation, by which he means the circumstances surrounding the signing of the contract in which Dali assigned his copyright to Descharnes's company.
