Best Answer: Esophageal cancer is a very aggressive cancer. Treatment of stage IV esophageal cancer usually includes chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgical removal of the affected part of the esophagus.Unfortunately, once it has spread, especially to places like the liver, long-term survival is not likely.tage IVA (any T, any N, M1a): This stage indicates that the esophageal cancer has spread to distant lymph nodes. If the esophageal cancer is in the upper part of the chest, it has spread to lymph nodes in the neck. For cancer of the lower part of the esophagus, it has spread to lymph nodes in the abdomen.
