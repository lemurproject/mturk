The Stanford prison experiment (SPE) was a study of the psychological effects of becoming a prisoner or prison guard. The experiment was conducted at Stanford University on August 14â20, 1971, by a team of researchers led by psychology professor Philip Zimbardo. The Experiment (2010), is a film released by Inferno Distribution which is an English-language remake of the 2001 film Das Experiment. 2  Prison School (first published February 7, 2011) is a Japanese serialized manga that heavily references the Stanford Prison Experiment as the inspiration for Kate's revenge plot.
