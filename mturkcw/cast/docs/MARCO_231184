In the 1970s, political scientists Gabriel Almond and Bingham Powell introduced a structural-functionalist approach to comparing political systems. They argued that, in order to understand a political system, it is necessary to understand not only its institutions (or structures) but also their respective functions.n the 1960s, functionalism was criticized for being unable to account for social change, or for structural contradictions and conflict (and thus was often called  consensus theory ). Also, it ignores inequalities including race, gender, class, which causes tension and conflict.
