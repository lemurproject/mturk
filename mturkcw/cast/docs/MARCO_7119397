Pupils may conduct a similar investigation, changing the number of leaves and measuring how fast each plant grows. It may lead to other experiments such as changing the amount of light plants receive and seeing the affect on growth and health. Children may also use the information from this clip to help them construct guides on how to grow plants well.
