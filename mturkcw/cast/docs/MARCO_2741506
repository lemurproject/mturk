Similar to Louis Pasteurâs spontaneous generation experiment, the 17th century Italian scientist Franceso Redi conducted an experiment to refute the theory of Spontaneous Generation nearly 200 years earlier. Francesco Redi showed that maggots do not spontaneously arise from decaying meat. To prove this he designed a simple controlled experiment, now referred to as the âRedi Experiment.â The idea of a controlled experiment is that two tests are identical in every aspect, except for one factor.
