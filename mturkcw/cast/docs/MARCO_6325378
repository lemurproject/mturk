Instead of it he creates a wrist gadget to shoot web.I would like to know if there is some logic of the producers behind this.he recent movie I watched was The Amazing Spider Man. But the difference I found in this movie and the last one was that, in this movie the spider man did not have his natural power to generate and shoot web.
