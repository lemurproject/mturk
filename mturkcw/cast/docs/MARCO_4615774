One is its Prime Instant Video streaming video that, like Netflix, offers a selection of movies and TV shows. For a while now, and unlike Netflix, Amazon Prime customers have been able to download and watch videos offline â but only if they either had an Amazon Fire tablet or bought or rented a movie.econd, and more importantly, is that the company now lets you download some Prime Instant Video movies and TV shows for offline viewing on Google Android and Apple iOS phones and tablets.I decided to give it a shot and see what happens.
