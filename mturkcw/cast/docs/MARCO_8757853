The Newseum is located at 555 Pennsylvania Avenue NW. NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY AND AMERICAN ART MUSEUM: Although it's a Smithsonian Museum, I'm including it on this list for two reasons: A) it stands apart from the cluster of National Mall museums, and B) It's quietly one of the best curated art museums in D.C.
