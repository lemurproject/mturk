This is a story about how one hair consumer received justice over a bad perm started on May 29, 1998 when I received an email to AskKaren from Belinda Rodgers of Ireland. Belinda who gave permission to share this story wrote: Hi Karen, I had a corkscrew or spiral perm put in my hair around a week ago.
