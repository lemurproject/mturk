The term sociology was coined by Auguste Comte in 1839. Comte is also the father of positivism. Comte's theory of positivism limits knowledge to the observable, and is crucial in approaching sociology as a science. The study of society dates back to Greek philosophers, however it was not distinguished as its own field of study until Comte.
