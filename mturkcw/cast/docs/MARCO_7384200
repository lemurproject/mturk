You can get down there in about 7 hours with no traffic. I can't imagine any pitfalls really. It's not a long drive by any means. You can always take Amtrak down there (about 8 hours) if you prefer. DC is an awesome city!! Best of all, most of the National Mall museums are free to go to other than the Air & Space Museum. The Spy Museum has an admission fee of around $18 and is pretty neat as well.
