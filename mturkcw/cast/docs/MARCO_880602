That's because of a simple adage that compares brains and brawns. Batman is a mere human, he has absolutely no super powers. His powers is only at par with Olympic level athletes. It is not too big a deal to defeat him in hand-to-hand combat. In-spite of this he is one of the most dangerous man on the planet. He is a master strategist and the world's greatest detective. Batman doesn't go all guns blazing into battle like most other superheroes. He plans and finds out his opponents weakness and hits where it is most effective.
