You can't receive a refund if any of the household members have placed an Amazon Prime eligible order. To cancel an Amazon Prime free trial, click Do not continue. Note: If you don't cancel your Amazon Prime free trial, you will automatically continue to a paid membership at the end of the trial period. You can find this date listed on the left-hand side of the Manage Your Prime Membership page. You will still have access to your Prime benefits until this date.
