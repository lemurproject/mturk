Spider-Man (along with its teammate Wolverine) debuted in 2001. It was driven by Brandon Harrington and Lee O'Donnell (2001 only) during the normal season and Gary Porter at the Word Finals. It would be driven by Bobby Z at the 2003 World Finals before the Clear Channel (now FELD Motorsports)/Marvel relationship ended.
