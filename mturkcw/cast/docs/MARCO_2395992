What is panentheism? Answer: Related to Process Theology, panentheism is essentially a combination of theism (God is the supreme being) and pantheism (God is everything). While pantheism says that God and the universe are coextensive, panentheism claims the God is greater than the universe and that the universe is contained within God. Panentheism holds that God is the âsupreme effectâ of the universe. God is everything in the universe, but God also is greater than the universe.
