The venous blood is never blue, it is a darker color of red than arterial blood, not blue. The color is a burgundy red or maroon color. Blood is bright red in the arteries and dark red in the veins.The reason venous blood is a darker red can be partially attributed to the slightly less oxygen in the blood in the veins.ed blood cells are red because the iron in the heme group of the four hemoglobin proteins react with oxygen (think what color rust is) to produce a red color.
