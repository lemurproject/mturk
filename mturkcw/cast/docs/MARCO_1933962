Why are poetry examples important? Studying examples of poems using various poetic devices helps such as couplet create an understanding of how those poetry terms work within different types of poetry. For instance examples of poems using onomatopoeia can illustrate how sounds can be represented in poems. Likewise, examples of poems using alliteration can shed light on how alliteration affects the rhythm of a poem. Many poem can be an example of couplet, but sometimes good examples are hard to find.
