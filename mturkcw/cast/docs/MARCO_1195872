Red Blood Cells. Red blood cells, also called erythrocytes, are the most abundant cell type in the blood. Other major blood components include plasma, white blood cells, and platelets. The primary function of red blood cells is to transport oxygen to body cells and deliver carbon dioxide to the lungs.A red blood cell has what is known as a biconcave shape. Both sides of the cell's surface curve inward like the interior of a sphere.s more red blood cells enter blood circulation, oxygen levels in the blood and tissues increase. When the kidneys sense the increase in oxygen levels in the blood, they slow the release of erythropoietin. As a result, red blood cell production decreases. Red blood cells circulate on average for about 4 months.
