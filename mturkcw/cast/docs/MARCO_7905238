Why are poetry examples important? Studying examples of poems using various poetic devices like metaphor helps create an understanding of how those poetry terms work within different types of poetry. For instance examples of poems using onomatopoeia can illustrate how sounds can be represented in poems. Likewise, examples of poems using alliteration can shed light on how alliteration affects the rhythm of a poem. Many poems can be an example of metaphor, but sometimes good examples are hard to find.
