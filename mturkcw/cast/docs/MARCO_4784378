Difference Between Pitch and Volume. Loudness and Pitch are characteristics of sounds. Loudness refers to the magnitude of the sound heard, and pitch is related to the frequency of the sound. Loudness, in common terms, is referred as the volume. Pitch and volume are parts of music and sound engineering vernacular, but the term loudness is used in physics. Pitch is the perception of the highness or the lowness of the sound/tone. It is strongly related to the frequency of the sound, but not exclusively.
