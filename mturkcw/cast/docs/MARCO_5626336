Employers should provide multiple avenues, some anonymous, to report unethical happenings in order to prevent that uncertainty and fear. Another way to promote the importance of ethical behavior is by providing meaningful and relevant training on the importance of ethics and how to handle ethical dilemmas. It is sad but true that most employees will experience some type of unethical act.
