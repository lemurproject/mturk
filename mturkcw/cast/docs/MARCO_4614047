I received a text from Verizon saying that I had used more than half of my data for the month on Saturday. Turns out, I had 2.2 GB of data used through Google Maps in just a few minutes of use, quadrupling what I had used the previous 3 weeks combined! This was in a familiar area of the city.his weekend I was using google maps to quick check how to get somewhere while my wife was driving. I had the GPS on but not the navigation, and was guiding her for about 10 minutes. All of a sudden my Galaxy S3 tells me I hit the data limit on my phone.
