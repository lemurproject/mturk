HPV does not cause health problems for most people. However, certain types of genital HPV can cause cervical, anal, vaginal, vulvar and throat cancers in women. HPV can also cause throat, anal and penile cancers in men. Other types of HPV can cause genital warts â growths around the vagina, penis or anus.
