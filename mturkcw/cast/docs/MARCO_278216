the social sciences, sociology emerged in Western Europe as a distinct discipline in the mid-1800s. Auguste Comte, Herbert Spencer, Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, and Max Weber were early thinkers in the development of sociology. The idea of applying the scientific method to the social world, known as positivism, was first proposed by Auguste Comte. Based on this innovation and Comteâs effort to apply the scientific method to social life, he is credited as being the founder of sociology.
