The eagle on the badge of the Society of the Cincinnati Medal looked more like a turkey, which prompted Franklin to compare the two birds as a symbol for the United States. For my own part I wish the Bald Eagle had not been chosen the Representative of our Country. He is a Bird of bad moral Character.
