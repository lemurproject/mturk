Batman vs. Superman may not be the movie some think it is. Source: Warner Bros. Make no mistake. Executives are betting that Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice can be for Time Warner, Inc.(NYSE:TWX) what Marvel's The Avengers was for Disney (NYSE:DIS).And why not? Thanks to The Avengers, Marvel movies possess a magnetic brand audiences are finding tough to resist.oth Batman and Superman have failed at the box office in years past. We often forget that Christopher Nolan helped resurrect the Batman film franchise eight years after it had been all but buried by the 1997 flop, Batman and Robin.
