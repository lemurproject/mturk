HBO shows coming to Amazon ... not Netflix. If you haven't seen The Sopranos we won't spoil it for you. But you'll soon be able to stream it and other HBO shows on Amazon Prime. Non-HBO subscribers will soon be able to watch some of the network's old TV shows, like The Sopranos and The Wire, on Amazon Prime's streaming video service.
