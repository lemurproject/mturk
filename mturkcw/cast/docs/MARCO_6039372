The cost can be calculated by compounding the rate of growth of 3% to the base cost, which is $14,240 in the year 1999. Again, using the 20% discount rate, the present value of NetFlixâs costs is $79,578.39.Subtracting the present value of corporate costs from the present value of revenues, the pre-tax enterprise value becomes $225,704.75.ith a total monthly cost of $14.15 per paid user, the total cash flow NetFlix generates is $5.85 per subscriber. If users view an average of one additional movie per month, total monthly cash flow generated per subscriber drops to $4.85.
