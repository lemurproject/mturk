Throat cancer occurs when cells in your throat develop genetic mutations. These mutations cause cells to grow uncontrollably and continue living after healthy cells would normally die. The accumulating cells can form a tumor in your throat. It's not clear what causes the mutation that causes throat cancer. But doctors have identified factors that may increase your risk.
