What is anemia? Anemia is a condition that occurs when the amount of hemoglobin in a person's blood drops below normal. A decrease in hemoglobin is often associated with a decrease in the number of red blood cells (RBCs) and hematocrit. Hemoglobin is contained within RBCs and is necessary to transport and deliver oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.
