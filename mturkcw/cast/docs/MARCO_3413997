MEL CARTER lyrics - Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me. MEL CARTER. Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me. Hold me, hold me. Never let me go until you've told me, told me. What I want to know and then just hold me, hold me. Make me tell you I'm in love with you. Thrill me (thrill me), thrill me (thrill me) Walk me down the lane where shadows.
