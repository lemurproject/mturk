Testicular cancer is rare, accounting for about 1% of all male cancers. However, testicular cancer is the most common form of cancer in men ages 15-35. Every year, in the U.S., an estimated 8500 men are diagnosed with testicular cancer and 350 die from the disease. That averages to every hour of every day some man hears, âYou have testicular cancer.â. Testicular cancer is one of the most treatable cancers, especially if caught early. If caught at an early stage, before it has spread, the survival rate is almost 100% but if caught at a late stage the rate drops to 80%.
