Turkey does have the makings of a natural sedative in iÂ­t, an amino acid called tryptophan. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid, meaning that the body can't manufacture it.The body has to get tryptophan and other essential amino acids from food.Tryptophan helps the body produce the B-vitamin niacin, which, Â­in turn, helps the body produce serotonin, a remarkable chemical that acts as a calming agent in the brain and plays a key role in sleep.he tryptophan in a Thanksgiving turkey has to vie with all the other amino acids that the body is trying to use. So only part of the tryptophan makes it to the brain to help produce serotonin. In the next section, we'll look at what may be the real reason why so many of us just want to take a nap on Thanksgiving.
