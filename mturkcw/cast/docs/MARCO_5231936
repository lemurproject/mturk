That is just one reason why careful observance of laboratory safety is important. Another reason why lab safety is important is because, within the laboratory, there are varied elements and substances that are deemed to exude and unpredictable properties. When one comes unprepared, oneâs life is definitely at the brink of danger. Even temperatures, voltages and variances among substances can make laboratories a dangerous place to work. Thus, safety precautions and adherence to laboratory rules are important factors that should never be ignored or taken for granted. It is a must that prior to entering laboratory facilities, proper attire is observed. This is not just to make one feel like a scientist but this is to ensure safety.
