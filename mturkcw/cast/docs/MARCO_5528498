What Causes Constipation? Constipation has many possible causes. This can make it difficult to find out whatâs causing your particular case of it. The cause can be as simple and easily fixed as a poor diet or as serious as colon cancer. More benign causes of constipation include a low-fiber diet, poor hydration, and a lack of regular exercise. Sedatives and medications that lower blood pressure may also cause constipation. Underlying medical conditions can also cause constipation.
