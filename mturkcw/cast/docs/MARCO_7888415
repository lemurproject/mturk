Batman is a winking, arch camp comedy that lampooned nigh everything about pop culture at the time. There are a lot of aspects of the show that remain iconic, but perhaps the most iconic thing of all is the cast of villains. In every episode of the series, Batman, Robinâand, by the third season, Batgirlâwould battle a villain. Some were great. Some wereâ¦ not so great. Here is a definitive ranking of all 34 villains from the Batman â66 series (not including Lee Meriwether as Catwoman, who only appeared in the movie).
