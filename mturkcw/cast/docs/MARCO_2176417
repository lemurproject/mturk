[â]tricky_fish 3 points4 points5 points 3 years ago (1 child) It even fits with the theme of the book: The story of the Empress is read by an ordinary boy whose story is read by the reader. Who in turn may be the subject of some other book; who knows. I think that this meaning of the neverending story got lost when the third layer became a movie.
