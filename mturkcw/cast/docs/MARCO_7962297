When to Go to Reykjavik The summer from June to August is the best time of year to visit Reykjavik when temperatures hit highs in mid fifties and days run together with up to 20 hours of sunlight. However, the hotel rates and travel prices reflect the short season, and so May and September are better times to visit for travelers on a budget.
