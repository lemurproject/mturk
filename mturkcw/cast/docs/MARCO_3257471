This hand painted on wood ornament is a beautiful addition to any tree with its bright red and white coloring! Mount Vernon was the beloved home of George Washington, first president of the United States, and if you've never been there, make an effort to see it if you're in the Washington, DC area. It's worth a full day's visit. George's older brother named the plantation Mount Vernon to honor his commanding officer.
