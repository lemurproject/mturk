If you plan on soaking the turkey legs in a marinade beforehand, factor in an additional four to 24 hours marinating time.Once the turkey legs are marinated or seasoned to your preference, heat a grill to âMediumâ heat.rill the turkey legs for approximately five to 10 minutes, then uncover the grill and turn the legs over. Replace the grill cover and continue grilling and flipping the turkey legs every five to 10 minutes until they are golden brown. Turkey legs generally require 20 to 30 minutes of total grilling time.
