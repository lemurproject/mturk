Whatever it does, this cloud service is certainly part of the application platformâit provides a service that the application relies on while it executes. From the point of view of the developer, services in the cloud just provide more options to use when designing and building an application. Just about every application today relies on other software: operating systems, database management software, even software running in the public cloud. Whatever it does and wherever it runs, all of this software together comprises an application platform.
