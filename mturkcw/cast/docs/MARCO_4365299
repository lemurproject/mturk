Every esophageal cancer patient is different. The cancer experts at Cancer Treatment Centers of America Â® (CTCA) have extensive experience in properly staging and diagnosing the disease, and developing a treatment plan that's tailored to your specific type of esophageal cancer. Adenocarcinomas is the most common type of esophageal cancer. This type of cancer forms in glandular cells in the lining of the esophagus that release mucus. It typically develops in the lower part of the esophagus, closer to the stomach. Squamous cell carcinoma develops in the flat cells that line the esophagus. This type of esophageal cancer is typically found in the upper and middle parts of the esophagus.
