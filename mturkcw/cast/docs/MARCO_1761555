Sociology of Cities and Suburbs. Judith Friedman, Dept. of Sociology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick. This course is one of a set of seminars designed for sociology majors. The prerequisites mean most of those enrolled have taken Research Methods or Analysis of Sociological Data, plus a theory course. Seminars have 20 students. I have taught this seminar twice now, and I am still making major changes.
