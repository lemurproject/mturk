The spleen (from Greek ÏÏÎ»Î®Î½ â splá¸n) is an organ found in virtually all vertebrates. Similar in structure to a large lymph node, it acts primarily as a blood filter. The spleen plays important roles in regard to red blood cells (also referred to as erythrocytes) and the immune system.It removes old red blood cells and holds a reserve of blood, which can be valuable in case of hemorrhagic shock, and also recycles iron. Storage of red blood cells, lymphocytes and other formed elements. 2  In horses, roughly 30% of the red blood cells are stored there. 3  The red blood cells can be released when needed. 4  In humans, up to a cup (236.5 ml) of red blood cells can be held in the spleen and released in cases of hypovolemia.
