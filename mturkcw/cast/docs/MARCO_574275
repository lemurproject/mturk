Colorectal cancer is both preventable and treatable if detected early. Studies show that regular screening could prevent one-third of colorectal cancer deaths in the U.S. The five-year survival rate is 90% if detected early. Screening tests that look for and remove polyps and lesions in the colon can prevent colorectal cancer.
