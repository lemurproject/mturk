<BODY>
Conflict theory is the second major school of thought in sociology. Like functionalism, it is a macro-level theory, but unlike functionalism, it is centrally concerned with social inequality. Conflict theory emerged from the writings of Karl Marx, and sees social conflict as the basis of society and social change.
