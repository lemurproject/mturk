Both CFD analysis and real-time monitoring have their place in making data center efficiency gains. CFD is clearly the choice for âwhat ifâ analysis. Real-time monitoring allows instant evaluation of any changes to the environment.nother data center CFD option is Coolsim, a SaaS (Software as a Service) that allows data input at the local level and computation in the cloud. Significant differences in the capabilities of these tools exist and the needs of the data center should be weighed carefully when choosing a simulation tool.
