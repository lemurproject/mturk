Anemia is not a single disease but a condition, like fever, with many possible causes and many forms. Causes of anemia include nutritional deficiencies, inherited genetic defects, medication-related side effects, and chronic disease. It can also occur because of blood loss from injury or internal bleeding, the destruction of red blood cells, or insufficient red blood cell production.
