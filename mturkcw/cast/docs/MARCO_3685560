The sociology of education is the study of how public institutions and individual experiences affect education and its outcomes.It is mostly concerned with the public schooling systems of modern industrial societies, including the expansion of higher, further, adult, and continuing education.t is also perceived as one of the best means of achieving greater social equality.
