Still, even if you subscribe to Amazon Prime simply for access to its streaming video library, $7.99 per month puts it on an equal level with Netflix and Hulu, and you get the other perks as an added benefit.ith Amazon Prime, subscribers get a lot of benefits from the popular online retailer: Free Two-Day, Standard, and no-rush Shipping, access to the Prime Instant Video streaming service, and access to the Kindle Lending Library where subscribers can freely borrow and read Kindle books as often as they like.
