Experiments can be done in the field or in a laboratory. They can involve human or animal subjects. What distinguishes the type of experiment is the degree to which the experimenter can assign subjects to conditions. Three types are described here: True, Quasi- and Single-subject experiments. In a true experiment, subjects are randomly assigned to the treatment conditions (levels of the independent variable).
