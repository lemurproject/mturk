Originally, emo was a genre of music in the late 80's and early 90's. That form of music has been lost, and we now have modern emo. You hear a lot of whinning from these original emo guys, but the truth is, emo does not mean what it meant a decade ago. Honestly, gay used to mean happy, and it sure doesn't mean that now.
