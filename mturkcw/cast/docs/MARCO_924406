The Î±-chains and Î²-chains combine to form the body of hemoglobin. Usually the Î±-chains combine with the Î²-chains rather than Î±-chains and Î±-chains while Î²-chains combine with Î²-chains. The latter is not expressed before birth. Hemoglobin protein which is found only during fetal development is called gamma (Î³).s one oxygen molecule binds to one heme group, the oxygen affinity for the other groups increase. Once an oxygen molecule is released, this stimulates the release of the other oxygen molecules. This makes hemoglobin ideal in transporting and releasing oxygen from lungs to tissues where it is needed.
