Fiberglass pools also require less chemical treatment, a major upkeep cost of any swimming pool. Because they are non-porous, fiberglass pools are also more resistant to algae. Using less chemicals could literally save you hundreds of dollars per year.owever, if cost is the only reason youâve eliminated fiberglass pools as an option, you might want to take another look at the numbers. Youâre going to have your inground pool for a long time, so it only makes sense to take a long view of the costs.
