the rule for drawing the piecewise linear approximation for a real pole can be stated thus for a simple real pole the piecewise linear asymptotic bode plot for magnitude is at 0 db until the break frequency and then drops at 20 db per decade i e the slope is 20 db decadeor a simple pole at the origin draw a straight line with a slope of 20 db per decade and going through 0 db at 1 rad sec an n th order pole has a slope of 20 n db decade the phase plot is at 90
