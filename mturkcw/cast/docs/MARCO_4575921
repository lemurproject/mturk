A satellite is any object that moves in a curved path around a planet. The moon is Earth's original, natural satellite, and there are many man-made (artificial) satellites, usually closer to Earth. The path a satellite follows is an orbit, which sometimes takes the shape of a circle.To understand why satellites move this way, we must revisit our friend Newton.Newton proposed that a force -- gravity -- exists between any two objects in the universe.he path a satellite follows is an orbit, which sometimes takes the shape of a circle.
