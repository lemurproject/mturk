Wild Turkeys (full grown) Weight: Males 8-24 pounds (3.6-11 kg), females 7-16 pounds (3.2-7.2 kg). Male domestic turkeys have been known to get as heavy as 86 pounds (40 kg). A domestic turkey weighs about twice what a wild turkey weighs. Male wild turkeys grow to about four feet long, including the tail.f you have turkeys that can fly, their enclosed cage should have chicken wire surrounding it on all sides and top with a wood frame with a stiff metal dog wire of about 3-4 feet tall along the bottom to keep out other animals and to keep the turkeys in.
