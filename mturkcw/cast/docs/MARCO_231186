This approach looks at both social structure and social functions. Functionalism addresses society as a whole in terms of the function of its constituent elements; namely norms, customs, traditions, and institutions.n the 1960s, functionalism was criticized for being unable to account for social change, or for structural contradictions and conflict (and thus was often called  consensus theory ). Also, it ignores inequalities including race, gender, class, which causes tension and conflict.
