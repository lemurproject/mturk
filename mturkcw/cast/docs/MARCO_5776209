At Comic-Con in July, Warner Bros. announced that the Man of Steel sequel would actually pit Superman against Batman, which is a popular DC Comics storyline that could lead in to a Justice League movie (DC's version of The Avengers).dd in a boost from Avengers: Age of Ultron, and it seems like Captain America has the stronger hand right now. Of course, this isn't Captain America versus Superman alone; he also has to contend with Batman, who has a very strong track record at the box office.
