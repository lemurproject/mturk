The Apollo reservation system was used by United Airlines until March 3, 2012, when it switched to SHARES, a system used by its former Continental Airlines subsidiary. Apollo is still used by Galileo International (now part of Travelport GDS) travel agency customers in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Japan. Galileo UK was originally created from Travicom which was the world's first multi-access reservations system using the technology developed by Videcom.
