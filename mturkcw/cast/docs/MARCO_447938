Hiring managers love to ask behavioral questions â and one of their favorite subjects is conflict. Here are a few examples of conflict-related behavioral questions: â¢ Tell me about a team project when you had to work with someone difficult. â¢ Tell me about a time you had a conflict at work. â¢ Give an example of a time you had to respond to an unhappy manager/customer/colleague. â¢ Tell me about a time that you disagreed with a rule or approach. There are many other variations on this theme and it is a very common interview topic.
