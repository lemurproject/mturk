A turkey fossil not assignable to genus but similar to Meleagris is known from the Late Miocene of Westmoreland County, Virginia. In the modern genus Meleagris, a considerable number of species have been described, as turkey fossils are robust and fairly often found, and turkeys show great variation among individuals.ales of both turkey species have a distinctive fleshy wattle or protuberance that hangs from the top of the beak (called a snood).
