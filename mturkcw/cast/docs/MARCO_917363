<BODY>
Two bodies of different mass orbiting a common barycenter. The relative sizes and type of orbit are similar to the PlutoâCharon system. In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space.
