Erythrocytes or red blood cells carry oxygen and carbon dioxide throughout the bloodstream. So oxygen is carried inside of these cells. It is delivered to the tissues (w â¦ hich are composed of cells) when oxygen-containing red blood cells enter a capillary that passes through a tissue. The oxygen leaves the red blood cells and passes through the wall of the capillary where it can be taken up by the cells of the tissue. Blood type refers to particular proteins called antigens on the surface of these red blood cells. Some people's red blood cells have the A antigen on their surface; these people have type A blood. Some people have the B antigen and are type B. Some have both (AB) and some have neither (type O). Any given person will only have one blood type (you only have type O or type A blood) and all of the red blood cells in that person are the same type. No one of these blood types is any better or worse than transporting oxygen.
