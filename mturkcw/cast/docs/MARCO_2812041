About Ben Franklin. He loved to play duets with his daughter, Sally, she on the harpsichord and he on his beloved Armonica.. Of all the things Franklin accomplished, the Armonica gave him his greatest personal joy. Franklin loved to play Scottish songs as he felt their beauty lay in their simplicity.
