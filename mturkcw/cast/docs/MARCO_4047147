Podcasting can be described as push audio content. The push is to a targeted audience or an on-demand audience; those who want it. Another way to describe podcasting is that it is essentially downloaded audio files intended for listening on the move. Podcasts show up (pushed) when new content is produced. If you're a subscriber, you get the podcast right then.
