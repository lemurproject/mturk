Most Applications Will Require Drawings. Briefly, you apply for a patent by filling out a patent application and submitting it to a Patent Office and paying a fee-for example, for a U.S. patent you would apply to the USPTO, United States Patent and Trademark Office.he descriptions and claims are very important to a patent application, they are what the patent examiner will look at to determine if your invention is novel, useful, nonobvious, and correctly reduced to practice as covered in our lesson on patentable. It takes up to three years for a patent application to be granted.
