Orbits 'R' Us! Orbits 'R' Us! When we talk about how Earth and the other planets travel around the Sun, we say they orbit the Sun. Likewise, the moon orbits Earth. Many artificial satellites also orbit Earth. When it comes to satellites, space engineers have different types of orbits to choose from. Satellites can orbit Earth's equator or go over Earth's North and South Poles . . . or anything in between.
