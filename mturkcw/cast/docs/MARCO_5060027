A: Coughs are treated based on the type of cough it is. Dry coughs, that do not produce mucus, are best treated with a cough suppressant, such as dextromethorphan. However, a wet cough, that is producing mucus, should be treated with an expectorant, such as guaifenesin. Sore throats can be treated with throat lozenges, throat sprays, humidifiers, hot drinks, and warm salt water gargles. Over the counter pain relievers can also be helpful in treating sore throats. Acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are options. NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve). Sinus congestion can be relieved with decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine.
