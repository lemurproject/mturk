Evolution myths: âSurvival of the fittestâ justifies âeveryone for themselvesâ. The âfittestâ can be the most loving and selfless, not the most aggressive and violent. In any case, what happens in nature does not justify people behaving in the same way. The phrase â survival of the fittest â, which was coined not by Darwin but by the philosopher Herbert Spencer, is widely misunderstood.
