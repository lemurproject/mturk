Oracle Coherence. vs. BlueTalon. Relational online analytical processing (ROLAP) is a form of online analytical processing (OLAP) that performs dynamic multidimensional analysis of data stored in a relational database rather than in a multidimensional database (which is usually considered the OLAP standard).therwise, the query is created on the fly from the user request. Microsoft Access's PivotTable is an example of a three-tiered architecture. Since ROLAP uses a relational database, it requires more processing time and/or disk space to perform some of the tasks that multidimensional databases are designed for.
