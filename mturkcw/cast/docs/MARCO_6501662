Obi Wan is clearly the most powerful jedi. He killed Darth Maul as a PADAWAN. He then took care of Grievous when others failed. He was able to seriously maim the 2nd most powerful jedi on this list. He trained Luke Skywalker, who in turn, was able to turn Anakin back to the light side.He also was one of the few who survived the purge. If he is not the most powerful jedi, then I don't know who is. Obi-wan took out Darth Maul, one of the most skilled light-saber duelists of all time, while he was still a padewan.He killed Grievous, another skilled duelist.lso in episode III it was Anakin who pretty much embarassed Dooku while Obi wan was unconscious. Anakin Would of been the most powerful but never reached his full potential and should be 2 on this list to Luke who is one because he did reach his full potential.
