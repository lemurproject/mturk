Best Times to Visit Stockholm The best time to visit Stockholm is in the summer â albeit the city's priciest season â because the temperatures are warmest and daylight lasts the longest. Average summertime highs range between 68 and 71 degrees Fahrenheit, with the hottest weather occurring in mid-July.
