The great thing about writing horror, to me, is that if you want to, you can keep the reader in suspense, until the last line, as to whether the story (a) is supernatural or (b) about some wacked-out real-world weirdo.very story is, in its tiny way, a horror story. Horror is about fear and tragedy, and whether or not one is capable of overcoming those things. Itâs not all about severed heads or blood-glutton vampires. Itâs an existential thing, a tragic thing, and somewhere in every story this dark heart beats.
