Sit calmly and quietly, listening as turkeys move into a likely roosting spot. Youâll hear wing beats as they fly up; maybe even soft calling or gobbling as turkeys approach roost trees. With any luck youâll see them do this.Once in the trees, birds will often move from branch to branch, wings noisily flapping as they reposition.Okay, you know where turkeys sleep.ake your setup near where turkeys flew up the night before. If unpressured, they might land there in the morning. Roost gobbling and softer tree calling before fly-down as day breaks will allow you to reposition if necessary to gain the right setup position.
