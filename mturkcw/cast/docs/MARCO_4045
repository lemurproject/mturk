So what is Public Relations? Is it managing your image? Is it spin? Is it blasting news releases? That's not how we see it. To us, it's about your story. And the chance to tell it. It's about relationships with real people. Your customers. Who today, will embrace your story. If it's made for them. It's also about clicks. And tweets. And views and likes.
