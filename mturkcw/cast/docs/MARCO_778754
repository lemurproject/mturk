We refer to this as the app dashboard. All the data in this guide is stored in the docs-examples Firebase database; a read-only version of the app dashboard can be viewed by going to the Firebase URL in a browser. It's possible to directly access child nodes in the data as well.owever, to help developers that are storing arrays in a Firebase database, when data is read using val() or via the REST api, if the data looks like an array, Firebase clients will render it as an array.
