Satellites are objects orbiting a planet. The moon is a natural satellite. Artificial satellites are those put into orbit by man. The first artificial satellite was Sputnik I launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. Now almost fifty years later there are thousands of satellites orbiting the Earth at various heights.
