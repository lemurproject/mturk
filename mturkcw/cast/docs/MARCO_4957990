We take a look at Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu Plus and Vudu to check out the best online streaming deal based on selection, price and user friendliness. Amazon Prime ($79 per year). Amazon Prime offers access to over 10,000 instant videos, including NBC and CBS television shows.hile users can watch unlimited material on Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus, five or six videos will quickly add up to $20, more than any of the other packages cost per month. User Friendly: Vudu is not as clean looking as its older alternatives, Netflix and Hulu Plus, but it is more streamlined than Amazon Prime.
