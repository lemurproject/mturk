What is a SDI file? SDI stands for Single Document Interface. Files that contain the .sdi file extension are files that are used in word processing programs and other computer applications. The SDI file contains information that controls how the toolbars used within a user's application window work. When certain applications have multiple Windows open, each window has its own toolbar settings. The SDI file is what determines how the settings for the toolbars are assigned to each Window. The .sdi file extension is also used by the QuickBooks financial software. The SDI files created by this application store data files that are used by the program.
