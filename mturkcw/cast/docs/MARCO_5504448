It takes longer to cook a frozen Thanksgiving turkey. To determine the approximate cooking time for a frozen Thanksgiving turkey, follow this guideline from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA): Take the recommended cooking time for a thawed Thanksgiving turkey and add 50 percent of that time to the original time.or example, a Thanksgiving turkey that should take about five hours to roast if already thawed will take about seven hours and 30 minutes to roast if frozen.
