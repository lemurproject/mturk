Lung cancer is the most common cancer all around the world. According to the American Lung Association, there were 1.8 million new cases in 2012, as well as 1.6 million deaths from lung cancer. The most common type is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounting for 80 to 85 percent of all cases, according to the Lung Cancer Alliance. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents about 15 to 20 percent of lung cancers. At the time of diagnosis, two out of three people with SCLC are already in the extensive stage. Anyone can get lung cancer, but smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke is linked to about 90 percent of lung cancer cases.
