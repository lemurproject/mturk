A picture book is more than a book with illustrations. It's a book in which the pictures and the words work together to tell the story. How long is a picture book? A better question may be how short? Picture books average about 1000 words. A few picture books, especially nonfiction, may have more. Many have less. Some of the best picture books tell a story in a few hundred words. Books for the youngest children may have only a few dozen. And, of course, there are picture books with no words at all. Because this is a site for writers, however, I focus on books with text. How many words do you need to tell your particular story? That depends on the story. A good picture book text has vivid characters and strong action, just like any good story. The difference is not just that a picture book is shorter than, say, a chapter book, or middle grade novel.
