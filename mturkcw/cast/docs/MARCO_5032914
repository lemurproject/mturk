General lung cancer symptoms. Lung cancer symptoms â coughing up blood. It should be noted that whilst coughing up blood (haemoptysis) usually presenting as phlegm with blood in it, is perceived as being a sure sign of lung cancer, this is not always the case. There are many reasons why people cough up blood that have nothing to do with lung cancer. The most common reason is chest infection. Additional causes include nosebleeds, occasionally bleeding in the throat, irritation in the airways (tracheobronchitis) or inflammation of the stomach or oesophagus.
