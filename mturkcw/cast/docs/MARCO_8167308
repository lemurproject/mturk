Let's start at the left-hand side. On this particular diagram, planets, like Neptune, have nearly circular orbits (little change in range from the Sun) with low inclination. So Neptune's orbit makes a very short, thick, black slash near 30 AU. Kuiper belt objects usually have elliptical orbits with higher inclinations. More vertical loops indicate more circular orbits. Shorter loops indicate less-inclined orbits. The most up-and-down and least-tall of the loops are for Quaoar and Varuna. These are classical Kuiper belt objects, with nearly circular orbits ranging from 40-45 AU. They're doing their own thing, with, apparently, little influence from Neptune. All the other bodies on this diagram are in various orbital resonances with Neptune.
