Therapeutic approaches to anemia include the use of blood and blood products, immunotherapies, hormonal/nutritional therapies, and adjunctive therapies. The goal of therapy in acute anemia is to restore the hemodynamics of the vascular systems and to replace lost red blood cells. To achieve this, the practitioner may use mineral and vitamin supplements, blood transfusions, vasopressors, histamine (H2) antagonists, and glucocorticosteroids. Documentation of the etiology of anemia is essential in the selection of therapy. Not all microcytic anemias are caused by iron deficiency; some are iron-overloading disorders. Similarly, not all megaloblastic anemias are associated with either vitamin B-12 deficiency or folic acid deficiency.
