Thanksgiving Turkey. The turkey is the centerpiece of many meals, with over 51 million turkeys being consumed on Thanksgiving Day. Assuming you buy a 16-pound turkey, which costs approximately $1.44 per pound, according to the AFBF, it should cost about $23.04 for a turkey. A 16-pound turkey, along with the other items on the list, should be enough to feed 10 people and still have leftovers, said the AFBF.
