1 Remember that being emo doesn't mean you must wear black. 2  Emos, in fact, can often wear lighter colors. 3  You may be subjected to negative criticisms by your non-emo friends and possibly the majority of society if they aren't emo, so just ignore them.4  Don't confuse emo with scene. Like grunge or jam band music, most bands labeled as emo or emocore would probably take issue with the label anyway and prefer to just be called a rock band. 2  It's a sloppy term used by rock journalists and grabby fans to categorize completely different things in completely different regions over different times.
