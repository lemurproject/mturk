Best and worst time to go to Washington, D.C. The best time to visit Washington, D.C., is in September after Labor Day, as both temperatures and tourist crowds decrease from their respective summer peaks. The worst time to visit unfortunately coincides with one of the area's biggest draws, the Cherry Blossom Festival at the end of March to early April.
