Social psychology conducts its experiments both inside and outside of the laboratory. One notable social psychology experiment is the Stanford prison experiment conducted by Philip Zimbardo in 1971, although the extremity of this field experiment is not prototypical of the field.Another notable study is the Stanley Milgram obedience experiment, often known as the Milgram experiment.n the latter half of the 20th century, the phrase experimental psychology had shifted in meaning due to the expansion of psychology as a discipline and the growth in the size and number of its sub-disciplines.
