In real time operating system there is a little swapping of programs between primary and secondary memory. Most of the time, processes remain in primary memory in order to provide quick response, therefore, memory management in real time system is less demanding compared to other systems. The primary functions of the real time operating system are to: 1. Manage the processor and other system resources to meet the requirements of an application. 2. Synchronize with and respond to the system events. 3. Move the data efficiently among processes and to perform coordination among these processes.
