For Netflix, I believe the way it's set up is you can only it running on one console per brand. So if you have two Wii's, only one can have it. But you can have it on the Wii and the PS3 at the same time and be fine. You can also have someone else watching Netflix on both those systems at the same time. I've had little experience with Hulu Plus. It's neat because you get a lot of TV shows, a lot of new ones too. With Netflix you usually have to wait until the season is over and it's on DVD to watch episodes. The one thing I hated about Hulu Plus was the fact that it still had ads.
