What are CubeSats? These nanosatellites typically weigh between 1 and 10 kilograms and follow the popular âCubeSatâ standard, which defines the outer dimensions of the satellite within multiple cubic units of 10x10x10 cm. For instance, a 3-unit CubeSat has dimensions of 10x10x30 cm and weighs about 3-4 kg.
