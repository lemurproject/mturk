Native American Shamanism: Medicine Men/Women. Native American and First Nations cultures have diverse religious beliefs. There was never one universal Native American religion or spiritual system. Though many Native American cultures have traditional healers, ritualists, singers, mystics, lore-keepers and Medicine People, none of them ever used, or use, the term shaman to describe these religious leaders.
