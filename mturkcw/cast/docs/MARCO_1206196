Will The Crown Season 2 be on Netflix? As to when the second season will release, we think Netflix will continue having the blockbuster series as a regular fall release. We have it on good authority that the second season is already close to being finished and therefore there wonât be any issue with that. Like other Netflix Originals, The Crown hasnât gone down the road of splitting up its seasons into two halves either meaning that the next drop will likely be ten episodes too.
