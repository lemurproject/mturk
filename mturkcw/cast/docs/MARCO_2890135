This type of orbit is ideal for many communications and weather satellites. A geostationary orbit has an altitude of 22,240 miles (35,790 km), which results in an orbital speed of 6,880 mph (11,070 km/h). We can also apply the same equation to the orbit of the Earth around the Sun.This orbit is also not a perfect circle, but is pretty close to get a good estimate of the Earth's orbital speed.his type of orbit is ideal for many communications and weather satellites.
