Positivism is the objective and value-free observation, comparison, and experimentation applied to scientific inquiry. Positivism was Comte's way of describing the science needed for sociology to takes its place among the other scientific disciplines. His core work, The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte was translated by a British-born philosopher named Harriet Martineau (1802-1876).
