<BODY>
Towards the end, when his wife is lying in bed, he says something about her needing to have nightmares. As he says this, her fingers makes the classic Spiderman web-slinger motion with the two middle fingers of her hand striking the palm. Possibly a nod to how she needed a hero at the time, and Spidey was in her dream.
