Best Answer: The main idea or theme of a story are two different things. Themes are messages being sent across through the text. Ex... Money does not buy happiness or Love conquers all. Main ideas are the stories point or the reason behind it all. Such as Harry Potter defending the wizarding world. That is the point to the whole story. It is a summary of the entire idea, or the main point.
