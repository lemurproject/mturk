HBO's Standalone Streaming Service May Cost Almost Twice As Much As Netflix. HBO may charge around $15 per month for the standalone streaming service it plans to launch next year, according to Martin Peers at The Information. That price point is much higher than that of its competitors. Both Netflix and Hulu Plus subscriptions cost $7.99 per month, and Amazon Prime costs $99 per year, which equates to about $8.25 per month. That means HBO's streaming service could cost almost twice as much as its competitors â or $180 per year.
