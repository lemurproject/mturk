<BODY>
Throat or larynx cancer. Throat cancer is cancer of the vocal cords, larynx (voice box), or other areas of the throat. People who smoke or use tobacco are at risk of developing throat cancer. Drinking too much alcohol over a long time also increases risk. Smoking and drinking alcohol combined lead to an increased risk for throat cancer. Most throat cancers develop in adults older than 50.
