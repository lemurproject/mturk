Comparative politics. Comparative politics is a field and a method used in political science, characterized by an empirical approach based on the comparative method.In other words comparative politics is the study of the domestic politics, political institutions, and conflicts of countries.It often involves comparisons among countries and through time within single countries, emphasizing key patterns of similarity and difference.eter Mair and Richard Rose advance a slightly different definition, arguing that comparative politics is defined by a combination of a substantive focus on the study of countries' political systems and a method of identifying and explaining similarities and differences between these countries using common concepts.
