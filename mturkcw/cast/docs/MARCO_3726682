Thursday, July 15, 2010. A Part of my Family. Benâs Chili Bowl stands tall and proud on U street, fully aware of itâs incredible popularity. Itâs always packed with people, hungry for the famous and delicious chili. Each and every person in Washington D.C. feels a connection to Benâs, as if it is part of the family. Business is always booming and the long lines until 4 in the morning become a familiar face. Not only is the food fantastic but there is a gift shop, created because of the desire for Benâs Chili Bowl attire and items.
