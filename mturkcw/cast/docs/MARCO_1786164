<BODY>
It's the story of how Peter Parker got bit by a spider and became Spiderman....or how Bruce Wayne became Batman. It's a backstory. A story of the journey taken to the present day. Almost anything can have an origin story...your organization, your team, your product, your website, and you. In my keynote speaking, I've been telling the origin story of how I came to do the innovation facilitation & training work I do.
