Disney will launch an ad-free Netflix-style subscription video service in 2019. The announcement was made yesterday by Disney chief executive Bob Iger during an investorâs call. The yet-to-be-titled service is made possible by the expiration of Disneyâs three-year streaming deal with Netflix, which ends in 2018. Netflix will lose access to its library of Disney- and Pixar-branded feature films; the company had been paying an estimated $300 million to Disney annually for the rights to stream 10 new Disney releases. While the new service will make Disney a competitor to Netflix, the strategy is also designed as a hedge against âcord cutters,â the rapidly-growing number of people who are cancelling their cable and satellite subscriptions.
