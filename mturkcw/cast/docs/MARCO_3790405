If a personality trait runs in families, it may indicate that there is a genetic component to the trait because children share 50% of their genes with each parent. Twin studies involve an analysis of any differences between identical twins and fraternal twins.f a personality trait has a genetic component, an adopted child would show more similarities to their biological parents than their adoptive parents. Family studies, twin studies and adoption studies do not tell researchers what genes are involved.
