Estrangement from important others is a sad fact of life for many people. One of the most painful experiences a parent can have, for example, is to be rejected by an adult child who appears to want nothing to do with them. Estrangement between siblings, in-laws, neighbors, even coworkers, is also common. The reasons this happens are as diverse as the parties involved.
