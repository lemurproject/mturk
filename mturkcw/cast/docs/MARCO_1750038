What is 'Trap & Paint'? Trap & Paint is a new social event in Washington DC that merges âthe traphouseâ with the existing âwine and paintâ party culture. But because we do things different here at The Museum, we have added our own twist. DJ 5â9â, our in-house DJ, will have a playlist full of Gucci Mane, TI, Jeezy, 2 Chainz, UGK & More! Weâll stage the store as a âtrap houseâ for one night. Come ready to paint and ball out!
