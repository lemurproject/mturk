Difference Between Gene and Allele. A gene is a part of the DNA. Alleles on the other hand refer to different versions of the same gene. Genes are the different parts of the DNA that decide the genetic traits a person is going to have. Alleles are the different sequences on the DNA-they determine a single characteristic in an individual.
