NonSmall-Cell Lung Cancer Symptoms. The symptoms of lung cancer are caused by the primary tumor or by metastatic disease. The primary tumor may press on, invade, or damage surrounding tissues, blood vessels, or nerves. Metastatic lung cancer may cause similar problems in other parts of the body. As many as 10% of people with lung cancer have no symptoms.
