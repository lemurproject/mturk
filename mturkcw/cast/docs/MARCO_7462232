Practical Info. The International Spy museum is located on F Street NW, near the J Edgar Hoover FBI Building and the National Archives. The museum is accessible by metro and bus. Keep in mind, the museum is extremely popular with kids, and lines form early to get in. There's also a shop with everything you need for your next secret mission.
