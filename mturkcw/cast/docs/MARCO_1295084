What are lip cancers? Lip cancers are abnormal cells that grow out of control and form lesions or tumors on the lips. They are the most common type of oral cancers. These cancers develop in thin, flat cells â called squamous cells â that line the lips, mouth, tongue, cheeks, sinuses, throat, and hard and soft palates. Lip cancer and other kinds of oral cancers are types of head and neck cancers.
