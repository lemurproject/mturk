Then from there, it's an easy walk to the Washington Monument, which is easy to use as a landmark. The Washingon Monument is halfway between the Lincoln Memorial and the US Capitol. The Smithsonian museums are between the Wash Monument and the US Capital. Frankly, the easiest thing to do is hop on the Metro (subway) at DCA and take it into DC and get off at the Smithsonian station. That would bring you out in the heart of everything and you would save yourself about 2 miles of hoofing it.
