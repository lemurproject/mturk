<BODY>
Bastian Balthazar Bux is a shy, awkward, and plump little boy who is tired of being bullied in school. One blustery stormy day Bastien goes inside of an antique bookstore and discovered a mysterious book called the Neverending Story. When the bookshop owner Mr. Coreander is not looking, Bastien steals the book and hides in the attic of his school to read it. It is only when he begins to read the Neverending Story that his adventure truly begins.
