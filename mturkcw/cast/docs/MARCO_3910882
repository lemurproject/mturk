See how we make money here. Getting free Netflix is possible if you sign up with Netflix (NLFX) and then cancel the service before the end of the first month. I have been using Netflix for almost two years now, and I sometimes wonder what I'd do without it for my entertainment fix.epending on my schedule and mood, I can choose to receive DVDs by mail, or watch many great movies and TV series through their instant streaming. Before you sign up for a Netflix free trial, read this review to find out more about the pros and cons of Netflix.
