A: Netflix's pricing is simple: It's $7.99/month for unlimited streaming, with access to their over 100,000 videos. Netflix also provides a DVD-by-mail add-on service that includes a wider selection of movies and TV shows that is also $7.99/month. So for both DVDs and streaming, it would be $15.98.
