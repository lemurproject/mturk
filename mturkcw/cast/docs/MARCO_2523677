Emo vs Scene. People often see little difference between Emo and scene. It is often hard to make a distinction between an emo kid and a scene kid as both look almost the same. But the fact is that one can come across many differences in their clothing, hairstyle, dressing and even character.hile the emo people are emotional, the scene people are a kind of crazy and random. While the Scene kids are bright and more enthusiastic, emo ones are more dark and depressed. When the emos are dejected, the scene kids are girly and happy. The scene people also look for attention.
