Hereâs the real story: in 2006 and 2007, Blockbuster had Netflix on the ropes and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings was asking them to acquire his company. No, Blockbuster didnât fail because of the competition; it failed because of boardroom infighting and one of the most disastrous CEO changes in American business history.
