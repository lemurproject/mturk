Theme is defined as a main idea or an underlying meaning of a literary work that may be stated directly or indirectly. Major and minor themes are two types of themes that appear in literary works. A major theme is an idea that a writer repeats in his work, making it the most significant idea in a literary work. A minor theme, on the other hand, refers to an idea that appears in a work briefly and gives way to another minor theme.
