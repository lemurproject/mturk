<BODY>
Blood gets its color from red blood cells called hemoglobin, to which oxygen binds. Ninety-seven percent of the oxygen transported by the blood from the lungs is carried by hemoglobin. Besides carrying oxygen around the body, hemoglobin helps remove carbon dioxide from the body. The difference in color between venous blood and arterial blood is known as the arteriovenous oxygen difference. Venous blood is also colder than arterial blood due to its lower oxygen content and pH.
