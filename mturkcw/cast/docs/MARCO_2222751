Anemia is a condition that develops when your blood lacks enough healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a main part of red blood cells and binds oxygen. If you have too few or abnormal red blood cells, or your hemoglobin is abnormal or low, the cells in your body will not get enough oxygen.Symptoms of anemia -- like fatigue -- occur because organs aren't getting what they need to function properly.nherited disorders can affect your bodyâs production of red blood cells. Thalassemias cause the body to make fewer healthy red blood cells and less hemoglobin -- and may be treated with blood transfusions. Among people with hemolytic anemia, red blood cells are destroyed and cleaned out of the bloodstream too quickly.
