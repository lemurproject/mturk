The turkey! The turkey is âa much more respectable bird and a true native of the country.â. In truth, both species are natives of the United States. The bald eagle was chosen because it stands for strength, courage and freedom. Although the turkey was not chosen for our national symbol, it is the symbol of one of our most famous national holidays, Thanksgiving.
