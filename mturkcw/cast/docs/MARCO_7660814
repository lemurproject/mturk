Regarding the Netflix server error, I recently read that Samsung's Netflix app resides on Samsung's servers, not in the TV. Additionally Samsung often has problems resulting in server outages. They just had a major outage recently. Google Samsung server outage to get an idea of the extent of the problems.ow to delete and reinstall a faulty app on Samsung smart tv. by Laura_t82 / September 26, 2013 3:06 AM PDT. Netflix has been working fine and when I've just tried to go back into it it comes up with the error message: 'There is a problem in starting netflix (err:server is not started).
