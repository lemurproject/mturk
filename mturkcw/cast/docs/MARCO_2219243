Of course, the online store never sleeps. Admission to the National Mustard Museum is FREE â¦ although the best way for the Museum to remain free is to encourage visitors to drop a donation in our Donation Box, make a tasty purchase in the Museumâs Gift Shop or online store, or make a donation online.
