Itâs unfortunate that Netflix does not announce the exact time the series will be released on Netflix. As weâve been following Netflix and their workings regularly for years, we have a great idea when the shows and movies will be released on Netflix. Usually, Netflix releases their shows, movies, and specials at 12:01 a.m. Pacific time on the day of the release. That means Fuller House will be available to stream on Netflix just after midnight on the West Coast. If you live on the West Coast, you can easily power through a few episodes before morning!
