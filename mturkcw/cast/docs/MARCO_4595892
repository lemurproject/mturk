Surgery to the tongue can cause problems with your speech and changes in eating and drinking. Radiotherapy to the head and neck area can cause several side effects including a dry, sore mouth and taste changes. There is information about the side effects of radiotherapy to the mouth in the mouth cancer section.ancers that develop in this part of the tongue come under a group of cancers called mouth (oral) cancer. The base of the tongue is the back third of the tongue. This part is very near your throat (pharynx). Cancers that develop in this part are called oropharyngeal cancers (pronounced oar-o-farin-gee-al).
