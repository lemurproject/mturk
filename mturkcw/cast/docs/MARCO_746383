The head of the bird is white, the body of the bird is black, and the tail is white. The feet are a dull orange and its beak is yellow. The Bald Eagle is a large fierce looking bird. It's name in Latin means the sea eagle with a white head. It is the national symbol of the United States of America. Benjamin Franklin had suggested that the national symbol be the Wild Turkey, because the Bald Eagle was a bird of bad moral character, but he was outvoted. Today it is seen on many things in the United States, such as money, seals, and other patriotic symbols. The Bald Eagle generally lives forty-five to fifty years in captivity and twenty-five years in the wild. It is one of the largest flying birds seen in the United States. It stands between 30.4 and 36.4 inches tall, or about as high as an average office desk. It has a five and a half to eight foot wing span. That's about as long as a big dining room table.
