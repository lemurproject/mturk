Lung cancer symptoms Symptoms of lung cancer vary depending on whether the disease is in its early or late stages. In early stage (stage 1 and stage 2) lung cancer, the cancerous tumor is typically no bigger than 2 inches and hasnât spread to your lymph nodes. Minor symptoms, such as coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath, may appear during this time.
