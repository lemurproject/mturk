Zimbardo and his team set out to test the idea that the inherent personality traits of prisoners and guards were key to understanding abusive prison situations. The Stanford experiment ended on August 20, 1971, only 6 days after it began instead of the 14 it was supposed to have lasted. have recently been learning about the famous prison experiment by Phillip Zimbardo and although I understand everything that happened, I am slightly unsure as to what the actual purpose of the experiment was. Could somebody please help let me know. Add your answer. Source.
