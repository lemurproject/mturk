As more cancer cells develop, they can form into a tumor and spread to other areas of the body. To learn more about how cancers start and spread, see What Is Cancer? Types of lung cancer. The 2 main types of lung cancer are: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), which is sometimes called oat cell cancer. About 10% to 15% of lung cancers are SCLC. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which makes up about 80% to 85% of lung cancers. The 3 main types of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. Small cell and non-small cell lung cancers are treated differently. The information here focuses on small cell lung cancer. See Lung Cancer (Non-Small Cell) for information about that type of lung cancer. Other types of lung cancer and tumors. Lung carcinoid tumors: Less than 5% of lung tumors are carcinoid tumors of the lung. Most of these grow slowly. For more information about these tumors, see Lung Carcinoid Tumor.
