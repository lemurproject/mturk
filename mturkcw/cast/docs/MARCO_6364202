The amount of marijuana that youâve smoked also determines how long THC will stay in your system for.f you smoke marijuana on a regular basis it will stay in your system for as long as 45 days, and if you smoke marijuana at a constant pace, it can stay in the body for 90 days, Marijuana is fat soluble.
