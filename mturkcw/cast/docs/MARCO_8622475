Real performance has to do with how fast your application actually calculates or performs operations. You can combine various techniques of code optimization to produce an application that is very fast. Perceived performance is about how fast the application looks and feels to the user. While this is often related to real performance, it is different because it may employ techniques contrary to those used to achieve real performance. For example, your application may use a large client-side cursor to avoid frequent database access and network traffic.
