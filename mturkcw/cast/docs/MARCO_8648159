Although it didnât win the award, Disneyâs Beauty and the Beast (1991) was the first animated movie to receive a nomination for Best Picture. Since then, Pixarâs Up (2009) and Toy Story 3 (2010) have also received Best Picture nominations. In 2001, the Academy introduced a Best Animated Feature Film category.
