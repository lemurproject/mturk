Active Mode. Active mode is how FTP originally worked, and it is still supported (and occasionally required) by many servers. In active mode, the control connection is made from the FTP client but all data connections are made from the FTP server to the FTP client. (Yes, back the other way.) In order for this to work, you usually need either no firewalls or firewalls that understand the FTP protocol and can dynamically open ports between clients and servers that look like they are performing ACTIVE mode FTP transfers.
