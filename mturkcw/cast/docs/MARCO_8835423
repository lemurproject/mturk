Tuxedo VS Suit. When someone is asked the difference between a tuxedo and suit, the main answer you will receive is âI donât knowâ. The majority of people have no clue what the difference between the two is and the difference only has to do with one type of fabric. As you read below you will find that the difference between a tuxedo and suit is a lot similar then you think. When it comes to the difference between a suit and tuxedo, the primary physical difference between a tuxedo and a suit is the presence of satin. When you are looking at a tuxedo, it will traditionally have satin facing on the lapels, buttons, pocket trim, and a satin side stripe down the leg of the trousers.
