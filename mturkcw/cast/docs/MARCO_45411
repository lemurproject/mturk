The country is called Turkey because it's home to the Turks. When European settlers arrived in America, they encountered turkeys, which they mistook for being a guineaufowl. â¦ The guineafowl was also called the turkey fowl because it was imported into Western Europe regularly from Turkey.ell actually the word Turkey (country) came from England. The English said it was too hard to pronounce the word Turkiye I mean all you have to say is turk-ee-air.. That's what I hate about those pesky English fools. They think they have the right to say any word their way!
