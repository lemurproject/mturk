<BODY>
At either end of the esophagus are ring-shaped muscles (the upper and lower esophageal sphincters), which open and close. The esophageal sphincters normally prevent the contents of the stomach from flowing back into the esophagus or throat. How the Esophagus Works As a person swallows, food moves from the mouth to the throat, also called the pharynx (1).
