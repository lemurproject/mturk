The Avengers was produced by ABC Television, a contractor within the ITV network. After a merger in July 1968 ABC Television became Thames Television which continued production of the series, although it was still broadcast under the ABC name. By 1969 The Avengers was shown in more than 90 countries. The Avengers was the longest continuously running espionage series until 24. ITV produced a sequel series The New Avengers (1976â1977) with Patrick Macnee returning as John Steed, and two new partners.
