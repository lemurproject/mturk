Cancer and its treatment can sometimes cause difficulty chewing and/or swallowing. Difficulty chewing can result from physical changes to the mouth, jaw or tongue caused by cancers like oral cancer. Pain or difficulty swallowing, or dysphagia, is a common symptom of cancers like throat cancer and esophageal cancer. Symptoms of dysphagia may include pain while swallowing, inability to swallow, choking or coughing while eating, a sensation of food getting stuck in the throat, and soreness, pain and/or swelling in the throat or mouth. Difficulty chewing and/or swallowing can be scary.
