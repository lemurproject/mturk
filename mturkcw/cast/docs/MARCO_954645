A satelliteâs orbit depends on its speed and distance from Earth. Below, the main orbit types are listed and defined. 1. LEO (Low Earth Orbit) - When a satellite circles close to Earth, itâs in Low Earth Orbit. Satellites in LEO are just 200-300 miles high. Because they orbit so close to the Earth, they must travel very fast (17,000 mph) so the gravity canât pull them back into the Earthâs atmosphere. a. Polar orbit-A satellite in polar orbit travels a north-south direction.
