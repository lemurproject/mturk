Anemia occurs when the amount of hemoglobin in a personâs blood is too low. This means there is not enough delivery of oxygen to the body. This can cause paleness, tiredness or fatigue, and weakness. Anemia can last a short time or a long time. In mild cases, treatment is a simple change in diet.
