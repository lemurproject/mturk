Box Office: 'Star Wars: Force Awakens' Tops 'Avatar' to Become No. 1 Film of All Time in North America. J.J. Abrams' record-shattering blockbuster achieved the historic milestone Wednesday after only 20 days in release. Globally, 'Force Awakens' is a long way from matching the $2.78 billion earned by 'Avatar.'. It's official: J.J. Abrams' Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the highest-grossing film of all time in North America, not accounting for inflation. On Wednesday, the Disney and Lucasfilm mega-blockbuster overtook the $760.5 million earned by James Cameron's Avatar.
