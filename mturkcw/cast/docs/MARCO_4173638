<BODY>
Royal titles in music - a strange thing. But they exist, so I accept it. 80-90% of people in the world know that there is the King of Rock and Roll (Elvis), the King of Pop (Michael), the Queen of Pop (Madonna), the Queen of soul music (Aretha), the Princess of pop music (Britney). The others - impostors. Talk about kings and queens only if it is world-known and accepted by most people.
