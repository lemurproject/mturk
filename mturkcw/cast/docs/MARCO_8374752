How long does a sore throat last? A sore throat, also referred to as a throat infection, is an inflammation of the pharynx that is located in the back part of the throat. The question that lingers on most peoples minds is how long does a sore throat last? The duration of a sore throat depends on its cause. For exampleâa sore throat caused by persistent irritation such as smoking cigarettes or other toxic stuff, can last for the duration that the individual is exposed to the offending substance. However, a sore throat despite its cause should last between 7 to 10 days. Any sore throat symptoms lasting for more than ten days necessitate immediate doctorâs attention for diagnosis and further treatment. This is because such sore throats can be underlying symptoms of serious illnesses such as throat cancer or even AIDS. Another common question is; how long does a sore throat last if it caused by a virus? Viral sore throats that mostly produce flu- like symptoms last for a few daysâat most seven to ten days. Viral sore throats get better after the first few days, and normally clear up when the flu disappears.
