How do you cook turkey in a smoker? Smoke a turkey using a water smoker by cooking it to an internal temperature of 175-180 degrees Fahrenheit in the thigh and at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit in the breast. In an electric smoker, set the smoker to 225 degrees Fahrenheit. With both smokers, it takes up to 12 hours to smoke a turkey.
