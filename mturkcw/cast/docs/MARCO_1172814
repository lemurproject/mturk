I'm still using the original Westell 327W with 4.04 firmware. The connection is a pretty solid ADSL2 at 1786/443. The new Netgear(Westell) 7550 Frontier sent syncs at the same rate, but says I only have 6.1 dB download margin whereas the Westell 327W says 21.5 dB.Plus the new Netgear reboots a few times an hour, so I kept the 327W.I'm not sure if the Westell is being overly optimistic about the SNR, or it's just a crap 7550 that.he new Netgear(Westell) 7550 Frontier sent syncs at the same rate, but says I only have 6.1 dB download margin whereas the Westell 327W says 21.5 dB.
