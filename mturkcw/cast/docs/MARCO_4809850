What are some famous foods in italy? Food in Italy is very regional-- what's famous depends on where you are. The most famous export comes from Naples, and that is pizza. From the North there is polenta and panneâ¦tone, from Sicily there's cannoli. Mozzarella cheese is found throughout the country. There are MANY more, but I hope this helps :)
