The hybrid orbitals will each have the same energy but will be different in energy from the original atomic orbitals. In sp 3 hybridization one s and three p valence atomic orbitals mix up together to form a new set of our sp 3 hybrid orbitals.These are directed towards the corners of a regular tetrahedron and the angle between them is 109 o 29'. The summary of sp 3 hybridization is given below.Back to Top.he hybrid orbitals will each have the same energy but will be different in energy from the original atomic orbitals. In sp 3 hybridization one s and three p valence atomic orbitals mix up together to form a new set of our sp 3 hybrid orbitals.
