Breathing is accomplished with a shark's gills, and the shark's sense of smell is not connected to its mouth in any way. Sharks often don't know how something is going to taste until they've taken a bite. This is how some people are able to escape from a shark attack -- the shark gets a little nibble of a foot and decides to reject the prey. Can sharks hear as well as they smell?

Cartilage is lighter and more flexible than bone allowing the shark to make tight turns quickly and to stay afloat.harks are a remarkably diverse group of fish.
